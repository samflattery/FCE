This includes learning many types of tasks based on many types of experience, e.g. spotting  high-risk medical patients, recognizing speech, classifying text  documents, detecting credit card fraud, or driving autonomous vehicles.   10601 covers all or most of: concept learning, decision trees, neural networks, linear learning, active learning, estimation  the bias-variance tradeoff, hypothesis testing, Bayesian learning, the MDL principle, the Gibbs classifier, Naive Bayes, Bayes  Nets  Graphical Models, the EM algorithm, Hidden Markov Models, K-Nearest-Neighbors and nonparametric learning, reinforcement learning,  bagging, boosting and discriminative training.   Grading will be based on weekly or biweekly assignments (written and/or programming), a midterm, a final exam, and possibly a project (details may vary depending on the section).  10601 is recommended for quantitative Masters students  non-MLD PhD students.    Prerequisites (strictly enforced): strong quantitative aptitude, college probstats course, and programming proficiency.

        "desc": "Nearly every problem in machine learning can be formulated as the optimization of some function, possibly under some set of constraints. This universal reduction may seem to suggest that such optimization tasks are intractable. Fortunately, many real world problems have special structure, such as convexity, smoothness, separability, etc., which allow us to formulate optimization problems that can often be solved efficiently. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the formulation of optimization problems that exploit such structure, and in efficient solution methods for these problems. The main focus is on the formulation and solution of convex optimization problems, though we will discuss some recent advances in nonconvex optimization. These general concepts will also be illustrated through applications in machine learning and statistics. Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong numerate background to catch up and fully participate. Though not required, having taken 10-701 or an equivalent machine learning or statistical modeling class is strongly encouraged, as we will use applications in machine learning and statistics to demonstrate the concepts we cover in class. Students will work on an extensive optimization-based project throughout the semester.",

It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries.  This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces.  The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work.  This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems.  In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.",

        "desc": "Language technologies (search, text mining, information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, biological sequence analysis...) are at the forefront of this centurys information revolution.  In addition to their use of machine learning, these technologies rely centrally on classic statistical estimation techniques.   Yet most CS and engineering undergraduate programs do not prepare students in this area beyond an introductory probstats course.  This course is designed to plug this hole.  The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.  The course is designed for LTI  SCS graduate students, but others are welcome.  CS UG upperclassmen whove taken it have done well, though they found it challenging.  The 11-661 version does not require the course project.  Prerequisites: Strong quantitative aptitude.  Comfort with basic UG-level probability.  Some programming skill.",

This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces.  The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work.  This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems.  In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.",

        "desc": "Language technologies (search, text mining, information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, biological sequence analysis...) are at the forefront of this centurys information revolution.  In addition to their use of machine learning, these technologies rely centrally on classic statistical estimation techniques.   Yet most CS and engineering undergraduate programs do not prepare students in this area beyond an introductory probstats course.  This course is designed to plug this hole.  The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.  The course is designed for LTI  SCS graduate students, but others are welcome.  CS UG upperclassmen whove taken it have done well, though they found it challenging.  The 11-661 version does not require the course project.  Prerequisites: Strong quantitative aptitude.  Comfort with basic UG-level probability.  Some programming skill.",

        "desc": "Multimodal machine learning (MMML) is a vibrant multi-disciplinary research field which addresses some of the original goals of artificial intelligence by integrating and modeling multiple communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic and visual messages. With the initial research on audio-visual speech recognition and more recently with language vision projects such as image and video captioning, this research field brings some unique challenges for multimodal researchers given the heterogeneity of the data and the contingency often found between modalities.  The course will present the fundamental mathematical concepts in machine learning and deep learning relevant to the five main challenges in multimodal machine learning: (1) multimodal representation learning, (2) translation  mapping, (3) modality alignment, (4) multimodal fusion and (5) co-learning.  These include, but not limited to, multimodal auto-encoder, deep canonical correlation analysis, multi-kernel learning, attention models and multimodal recurrent neural networks. We will also review recent papers describing state-of-the-art probabilistic models and computational algorithms for MMML and discuss the current and upcoming challenges. The course will discuss many of the recent applications of MMML including multimodal affect recognition, image and video captioning and cross-modal multimedia retrieval.  This is a graduate course designed primarily for PhD and research master students at LTI, MLD, CSD, HCII and RI; others, for example (undergraduate) students of CS or from professional master programs, are advised to seek prior permission of the instructor. It is required for students to have taken an introduction machine learning course such as 10-401, 10-601, 10-701, 11-663, 11-441, 11-641 or 11-741. Prior knowledge of deep learning is recommended.",

Basic knowledge of NNs, known currently in the popular literature as deep learning, familiarity with various formalisms, and knowledge of tools, is now an essential requirement for any researcher or developer in most AI and NLP fields. This course is a broad introduction to the field of neural networks and their deep learning formalisms. The course traces some of the development of neural network theory and design through time, leading quickly to a discussion of various network formalisms, including simple feedforward, convolutional, recurrent, and probabilistic formalisms, the rationale behind their development, and challenges behind learning such networks and various proposed solutions. We subsequently cover various extensions and models that enable their application to various tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation and playing games. Instruction Unlike prior editions of 11-785, the instruction will primarily be through instructor lectures, and the occasional guest lecture. Evaluation Students will be evaluated based on weekly continuous-evaluation tests, and their performance in assignments and a final course project. There will be six hands-on assignments, requiring both low-level coding and toolkit-based implementation of neural networks, covering basic MLP, convolutional and recurrent formalisms, as well as one or more advanced tasks, in addition to the final project.",

The principles taught are applicable to a wide variety of air pollutants but special focus is given to tropospheric ozone and particulate matter. The course is intended for graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates. It assumes a knowledge of mass balances, fluid mechanics, chemistry, and statistics typical of an undergraduate engineer but is open to students from other scientific disciplines.",

The first part will provide a primer for those who are curious about the physical mechanisms by which climate is determined, and by which climate change occurs. The treatment of these mechanisms will not be overly quantitative, and no knowledge of meteorology or atmospheric science is needed. College-level physics, as well as basic calculus and basic chemistry, is, however, needed. The second part will describe the projected consequences of climate change, as well as those that are already occurring. This part will also familiarize students with how societies might adapt to these changes. The third part will explore (and critique) some of the tools that decision-makers use to quantify and compare the damages caused by these consequences. The final part of the course will discuss some of the technologies that could be used to prevent dangerous climate change.",

Using a top-down approach, we will cover topics in the application, transport, network and link layers of the protocol stack. We will also go over advanced topics, including network management, traffic engineering, and router internals. Besides learning about the nuts and bolts, you will gain an understanding as well in engineering tradeoffs made and design principles used in computer and telecommunication networks. Another objective is for you to apply some of this knowledge in the context of systems projects. We will follow an aggressive pace in this course. Prerequisites: Graduate standing.",

For the purpose of this course, cyber intelligence is the acquisition and analysis of information to identify, track, and predict cyber capabilities, intentions, and activities to offer courses of action that enhance decision making. Students will explore a different aspect of the definition each week to develop an analytic framework capable of discerning the interdependencies of and external influences on cyber intelligence, as it relates to an organization?s environment, data gathering, functional analysis, strategic analysis, and decision maker. The framework will demonstrate how traditional intelligence practices and emerging technologies influence cyber intelligence; empowering students to assess the likelihood of cyber threat actors executing attacks, the impact attacks have on an organization?s business, and the risk threats pose because of an organization?s known vulnerabilities.",

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course.",

Students will study its enabling technologies, building blocks, and gain hands-on experience through projects utilizing public cloud infrastructures.  Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains.  The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the clouds motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies. Finally, students will study the MapReduce, Spark and GraphLab programming models. Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications using these resources. Students will develop and evaluate scaling and load balancing solutions, work with cloud storage systems, and develop applications in several programming paradigms. 15619 students must complete an extra team project which entails designing and implementing a cost- and performance-sensitive web-service for querying big data.",

The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and team programming skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.  Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2s-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.

Designing algorithms to control CPSs, such as those in cars, aircraft and robots, is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior. At the same time, it is vital that these algorithms be correct, since we rely on CPSs for safety-critical tasks like keeping aircraft from colliding.  Students in this course will understand the core principles behind CPSs, develop models and controls, identify safety specifications and critical properties of CPSs, understand abstraction and system architectures, learn how to design by invariant, reason rigorously about CPS models, verify CPS models of appropriate scale, understand the semantics of a CPS model and develop an intuition for operational effects. Students will write hybrid programs (HPs), which capture relevant dynamical aspects of CPSs in a simple programming language with a simple semantics, allowing the programmer to refer to real-valued variables representing real quantities and specify their dynamics as part of the HP.",

Second, for students to gain practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems.  The major themes this course will teach include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects.

In this course, we concentrate on techniques that prove or suggest that there are no efficient methods to solve many important problems.  We will develop the theory of various complexity classes, such as P, NP, co-NP, PH, P, PSPACE, NC, AC, L, NL, UP, RP, BPP, IP, and PCP. We will study techniques to classify problems according to our available taxonomy. By developing a subtle pattern of reductions between classes we will suggest an (as yet unproven) picture of how by using limited amounts of various resources, we limit our computational power.",

Its role is to overcome the limitations of the traditional camera, by combining imaging and computation to enable new and enhanced ways of capturing, representing, and interacting with the physical world.  This advanced undergraduate course provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in computational photography. At the start of the course, we will study modern image processing pipelines, including those encountered on mobile phone and DSLR cameras, and advanced image and video editing algorithms. Then we will proceed to learn about the physical and computational aspects of tasks such as 3D scanning, coded photography, lightfield imaging, time-of-flight imaging, VR/AR displays, and computational light transport. Near the end of the course, we will discuss active research topics, such as creating cameras that capture video at the speed of light, cameras that look around walls, or cameras that can see through tissue.  The course has a strong hands-on component, in the form of seven homework assignments and a final project. In the homework assignments, students will have the opportunity to implement many of the techniques covered in the class, by both acquiring their own images of indoor and outdoor scenes and developing the computational tools needed to extract information from them. For their final projects, students will have the choice to use modern sensors provided by the instructors (lightfield cameras, time-of-flight cameras, depth sensors, structured light systems, etc.).  This course requires familarity with linear algebra, calculus, programming, and doing computations with images.  The course does not require prior experience with photography or imaging.",

        "desc": "Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems.  The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware  simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and team programming skills (source control,  modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.    Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at  Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able  to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2s-complement  arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The  instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before  the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.    Auditing:  this course is usually full, and we generally receive  many more requests to audit than we can accept.  If you wish to  audit, please have your advisor contact us before the semester  begins to discuss your educational goals.",

        "desc": "This course gives students an overview of Cloud Computing, which is the delivery of computing as a service over a network, whereby distributed resources are rented, rather than owned, by an end user as a utility. Students will study its enabling technologies, building blocks, and gain hands-on experience through projects utilizing public cloud infrastructures.  Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains.  The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the clouds motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies. Finally, students will study the MapReduce, Spark and GraphLab programming models.  Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications using these resources. Students will develop and evaluate scaling and load balancing solutions, work with cloud storage systems, and develop applications in several programming paradigms. 15619 students must complete an extra team project which entails designing and implementing a cost- and performance-sensitive web-service for querying big data.",

The major themes this course will teach include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects.

They often dominate the performance of a system, and their components inner workings require amazing feats of engineering. At the same time, storage systems hold the crown jewels of most organizations: their information (from source code to Microsofts software to the sales databases of every e-commerce site). Within the field of computer systems and computer engineering, there is no area whose demand for bright people and better solutions is more robust.   This course will cover the design, implementation, and use of storage systems, from the characteristics and operation of individual storage devices to the OS, database, and networking approaches involved in tying them together and making them useful. Along the way, we will examine several case studies of real systems, demands placed on storage systems by important applications, and impacts of trends and emerging technologies on future storage systems.   For those familiar with 18-316 (Intro. to Data Storage Systems Technology) and 18-517 (Data Storage Systems Design Project): one should consider these courses as distinct and complementary, with neither being a pre-requisite to the other. 18-316 and 18-517 focus on the low-level technologies (magnetics, materials, applied physics, etc.) whereas 746 focuses on storages incorporation and role in computer systems.

Description: In designing computer systems one is usually constrained by certain performance requirements and limitations. For example, one might need to guarantee a response time SLA or certain throughput requirement, while at the same time staying within a power budget or cost budget. On the other hand, one often has many choices: One fast disk, or two slow ones? More memory, or a faster processor? A fair scheduler or one that minimizes mean response time? For multi-server systems, one can choose from a wide array of load balancing policies, a wide array of migration policies, capacity provisioning schemes, power management policies ... The possibilities are endless. The best choices are often counter-intuitive. Ideally, one would like to have answers to these questions before investing the time and money to build a system. This class will introduce students to analytic stochastic modeling with the aim of answering the above questions.   This class is heavy on math.  Students should have a strong background in probability before embarking on this class.   If you are worried about your probability background, please work through all the examples and exercises in Chpt 3 of the class textbook.  You can also see the instructor for more probability materials.",

COURSES BEGIN THE WK OF SEPT3rd CC: Description: With the growing number of massive datasets in applications such as machine learning and numerical linear algebra, classical algorithms for processing such datasets are often no longer feasible. In this course we will cover algorithmic techniques, models, and lower bounds for handling such data. A common theme is the use of randomized methods, such as sketching and sampling, to provide dimensionality reduction. In the context of optimization problems, this leads to faster algorithms, and we will see examples of this in the form of least squares regression and low rank approximation of matrices and tensors, as well as robust variants of these problems. In the context of distributed algorithms, dimensionality reduction leads to communication-efficient protocols, while in the context of data stream algorithms, it leads to memory-efficient algorithms. We will study some of the above problems in such models, such as low rank approximation, but also consider a variety of classical streaming problems such as counting distinct elements, finding frequent items, and estimating norms....FF: Description: The course will focus on faster exact algorithms for NP-hard problems. Since exact algorithms for these problems cannot run in polynomial time, one direction is to get faster (though still exponential-time) algorithms. Another direction is to study fixed-parameter algorithms, which consider the fine-grained complexity of the problem in terms not only of the instance size n, but also of other parameters of the input (e.g., the treewidth of the instance, or the value of the optimal solution). The course will cover both algorithms and hardness results related to these topics.",

As we enter an age where companies like Uber are testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and innovative interfaces like IBMs Watson can play jeopardy and learn techniques for medical diagnoses, how are we to negotiate an intelligence explosion that for many individuals might threaten the very notions of what it means to be human?  The future of human-to-machine relationships will likely define our historical epoch and yet, many young technologists and humanists underestimate the downstream impact of technological innovations on human society.  Presently, we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question.  This seminar will attend to the challenge of present existential questions on what it means to be human (read not machine) in the context of a rapidly advancing technological age.  We will consider human narratives throughout history that exam how governments and individual citizens defined humanity in the context of slavery and colonialism as a framework for exploring and projecting what it means to be human in the age of rapidly advancing intelligent machines.  We will trace the technological advancements of the recent five decades and identify historical precedents and speculative narratives that help us to consider issues like labor, economic disparity, negotiations of power, human dignity and ethical responsibility within the context of human relations with advancing technological tools that are now coined, artificial intelligence.",

        "desc": "The art and science of machines which evoke human delight through physical movement is founded on a balance of form and computation.  This introductory physical computing course addresses the practical design and fabrication of robots, interactive gadgets, and kinetic sculptures.  The emphasis is on creating experiences for human audiences through the physical behavior of devices which embody computation with mechanism, sensing, and actuation.  Specific topics include basic electronics, elementary mechanical design, embedded programming, and parametric CAD.  A key objective is gaining an intuitive understanding of how information and energy move between the physical, electronic, and computational domains to create a compelling behavior.  The final projects are tested in the field on children and adults.  This interdisciplinary course is an IDeATe Portal Course open to students from all colleges.  For students choosing to follow an IDeATe program it is an entry into either Physical Computing or Intelligent Environments.  The structure of the class revolves around collaborative exercises and projects which introduce core physical computing and system engineering techniques in a human-centric context.  Students apply system and design thinking across multiple domains, work together to make and test several devices, and participate in wide-ranging critique which considers both technical and artistic success.",

        "desc": "This course is a comprehensive hands-on introduction to the concepts and basic algorithms needed to make a mobile robot function reliably and effectively. We will work in small groups with small robots that are controlled over wireless from your laptop computers. The robots are custom-designed mini forktrucks that can move pallets from place to place just like commercial automated guided vehicles do today. The robots are programmed in the modern MATLAB programming environment. It is a pretty easy language to learn, and a very powerful one for prototyping robotics algorithms. You will get a lot of experience in this course in addition to some theory. Lectures are focused on the content of the next lab. There is a lab every week and they build on each other so that a complete robot software system results. The course will culminate with a class-wide robot competition that tests the performance of all of your code implemented in the semester. In order to succeed in the course, students must have a 1) 2nd year science/engineering level background in mathematics (matrices, vectors, coordinate systems) and 2) have already mastered at least one procedural programming language like C or Java, and 3) have enough experience to be reasonably prepared to write a 5000 line software system in 13 weeks with the help of one or two others. When the course is over, you will have written a single software system that has been incrementally extended in functionality and regularly debugged throughout the semester.",

Systems Engineering is a formal discipline that guides a product from conception and design all the way to production, marketing, servicing, and disposal. The higher the complexity of the system, the more its creators benefit from applying formal processes such as Systems Engineering to its development. Topics in Systems Engineering covered in this course include needs and objectives analysis, requirements elicitation and formalization, system architecture development, trade studies, verification and validation, structured methodologies, etc. In the second part of this course we study key concepts of Project Management that must be performed along with Systems Engineering to achieve a successful project and product in a finite time period. For the Project Management portion of the course we cover topics such as work breakdown structures, scheduling, estimation, risk management, and agile methods.  This course is for MRSD students, and they will apply the concepts and methods they learn in this course to the MRSD Project Course I and II, thus giving them the opportunity to put the theory in practice in a requirements-driven robotic system development.",

The project course will allow students to form project teams to work on a hands-on robotics / automation topic proposed by the instructor(s) of interest to the robotics / automation industry at large. The project is intended to allow students to acquire hands-on experience and apply concepts and methods taught in class. Students will learn the interconnection of theory and practice and understand the challenges of real-world application. The setting will consist of a mix of targeted technology instruction / lectures and hands-on work in the laboratory. Students will be taught the project / technology development process all the way from developing performance-requirements/system-specifications through the technology development cycle, all the way to test-plan development and results analysis and reporting. The outcome of this two-semester course will be a final project report, coupled with a demonstration and group presentation.  The goal of the MRSD Project Course is to provide practical experience in robotic system development ranging from specification and design to implementation and testing. Projects will be defined jointly with industrial clients, and small student teams will work with these client companies in implementing, refining, and presenting the results of their projects. The course will provide opportunities to apply principles from other MRSD courses, especially the Systems Engineering course, as well as those from the Business Seminar series. Class lectures will emphasize practical application and cover relevant topics including robotic design methodologies, system modeling, mechanical components, sensor and I/O interfacing, motor control, microcontroller and embedded control basics, basic software development methodologies, and troubleshooting.",

These technical topics will be interspersed with business cases to challenge students to analyze given business situations and to construct proposed solutions.  Material on US stock markets will also be presented to illustrate how public companies can be understood and tracked.  Senior professors from the Tepper School of Business, Lawyers and Corporate Executives will provide the lectures for the majority of the classes.  This year we will have special lectures from from a robotics company and a venture capitalist group  The project will build a business case for an existing public robotics company (or related technology company) and will FRAME a BUSINESS PROBLEM based on the live situation.  The students will then put together a detailed (written) case following the basic case structure outlined in 16-697,  Should Apple go into the driverless car business?  How will Tesla raise the money to build its car for the masses?  How can Fit compete with the Apple watch?  These are just a few possible projects in 2017.

These systems must deal with uncertainty and adapt to changes  in the environment by learning from experience. Uncertainty arises  from many sources: the inherent limitations in our ability to model  the world, noise and perceptual limitations in sensor measurements,  and the approximate nature of algorithmic solutions. Building  intelligent machines also requires that they adapt to their  environment. Few things are more frustrating than machines that  repeat the same mistake over and over again. Well explore modern  learning techniques that are effective at learning online: i.e.  throughout the robots operation. Well explore how the twin ideas of uncertainty and adaptation are closely tied in both theory and implementation.",

This time involves deployment - the period between the completion of the code by the developers and the placing of the code into normal production  and dealing with operations issues. Deployment time can be days, weeks, or even months when using normal development practices. Operational issues such as dealing with incidents and errors introduce other delays.  Modern internet companies deploy a system multiple or even dozens of times every day. Achieving this velocity requires coordinated process and design activities together with supporting tooling. This course will cover the deployment process and the associated tooling, it will highlight reasons why release schedules can be slow, and it will introduce the practices that are used to enable high velocity deployments. It will also cover the kinds of problems that are created because of high velocity and how modern internet companies deal with these problems.",

        "desc": "Scientific foundations for software engineering depend on the use of precise, abstract models for describing and reasoning about properties of software systems. This course considers a variety of standard models for representing sequential and concurrent systems, such as state machines, algebras, and traces. It shows how different logics can be used to specify properties of systems, such as functional correctness, deadlock freedom, and internal consistency. Concepts such as compositionality, abstraction, invariants, non-determinism, and inductive definitions are recurrent themes throughout the course. After completing this course, students will:  1. Understand the strengths and weaknesses of certain models and logics including state machines, algebraic and process models, and temporal logic;  2. Be able to select and describe appropriate abstract formal models for certain classes of systems, describe abstraction relations between different levels of description, and reason about the correctness of refinements;  3. Be able to prove elementary properties about systems described by the models introduced in the course; and  4. Understand some of the strengths and weakness of formal automated reasoning tools.    Prerequisites: Undergraduate discrete math including first-order logic, sets, functions, relations, and simple proof techniques such as induction.   Sections D, PP and G are NOT available for on-campus students.   Admission to the class is by approval from the instructor: If you are not MSE/MSIT-SE/MITS, send email to garlan@cs.cmu.edu for permission to enroll. The email should briefly describe your background, whether you have taken an undergraduate discrete math course, and why you would like to take the course.

It deals with the most important and controversial issues in technology law today. The material is divided into six primary subjects: 1. Legal process: how courts operate, how lawsuits are conducted, what happens in appeals, who has to obey the determination of a court, over whom can a court exercise power, and regulatory law. 2. Evidence: what has to be proven to a court and how it is done, rules of evidence, burdens of proof, expert testimony. 3. Business Transactions: software licenses, clickwrap contracts, electronic transactions. 4. Personal Intrusions: social media, libel and defamation, data privacy, position monitoring. 5. Intellectual Property: trade secrets and confidentiality agreements. No legal background is required or assumed. This is not a law school course. Great effort is expended to keep the syllabus current based on breaking legal events. Therefore, the content and ordering of lectures may vary somewhat as the course progresses.",

The course starts with a review of the fundamental topics of programming in Java (data types, operators, control structures) along with discussions of object oriented programming (classes, instances, and class hierarchies). After covering the basics we move on using Java to cover simple graphical user interfaces (using Swing), file I/O, concurrency (i.e., threads), network I/O (HTTP), simple data structures (lists and maps).  Students are required to have a reasonably modern laptop computer on which they will need to install the Java software used for this course.

Signals are the raw materials used in many forms of electronic art and design - electronic music, interactive art, video art, kinetic sculpture, and more. In these fields, signals are used to represent information about sound, images, sensors, and movement. By transforming and manipulating these types of signals, we are able to create powerful new tools for digital art, multimedia applications, music, responsive environments, video and sound installation, smart products, and beyond.  In this course we will study Signal Processing from a practical point-of-view, developing tools that can be easily integrated into art-making using the graphical programming environment Max (a.k.a. Max/MSP/Jitter).  We will present a survey of Signal Processing techniques used in the sonic and visual arts, and will discuss the mathematical theories underlying these techniques.  Students will be encouraged to combine, modify, and extend working examples of software to create original digital artworks.",

The course covers the integrated hardware and software aspects of embedded processor architectures, along with advanced topics such as real-time, resource/device and memory management. Students can expect to learn how to program with the embedded architecture that is ubiquitous in cell-phones, portable gaming devices, robots, PDAs, etc. Students will then go on to learn and apply real-time principles that are used to drive critical embedded systems like automobiles, avionics, medical equipment, the Mars rover, etc.     Topics covered include embedded architectures (building up to modern 16/32/64-bit embedded processors); interaction with devices (buses, memory architectures, memory management, device drivers); concurrency (software and hardware interrupts, timers); real-time principles (multi-tasking, scheduling, synchronization); implementation trade-offs, profiling and code optimization (for performance and memory); embedded software (exception handling, loading, mode-switching, programming embedded systems). Through a series of laboratory exercises with state-of-the-art embedded processors and industry-strength development tools, students will acquire skills in the design/implementation/debugging of core embedded real-time functionality.

First, the general structure of an electric power system (current and future trends) will be introduced. This includes electric power plants (renewable and non-renewable); transmission and distribution; and consumers. Then, electric power is addressed from a mathematical point of view. The mathematical formulae for AC power and models for the above mentioned elements are derived which will enable you to calculate how much power is flowing over which lines on its way from the power plant to the consumer. Maintaining the balance between generation and consumption is important to avoid catastrophic blackout events. Hence, the notion of stability and available control concepts will be introduced.",

        "desc": "In a very real sense, embedded software is what makes our everyday world function. From self-driving cars to chemical processing plant equipment, and from medical devices to the electric grid, embedded software is everywhere. You already know how to write code for a microcontroller. Now, learn software quality, safety, and security skills that are required to make embedded systems that can handle the messiness of the real world. This course provides in-depth coverage of the topics that are essential to the success of embedded software projects based on case studies of industry project teams that have suffered or failed. Students will learn about a variety of topics including: lightweight but high quality embedded software processes, technical best practices for embedded software, effective testing and validation, causes of software system failures, software for safety-critical systems, and embedded-specific aspects of software security. The material will generally be broken up into a set of four related topics each week, with one assignment per topic weekly, involving a combination of programming assignments, tool use experiences, and research questions to get hands-on experience at dealing with the types of problems that are encountered in industry embedded projects. We assume you already know how to code in C and understand the basics of microcontrollers. This course is about getting you ready to build industry-strength embedded projects.

Straightforward implementations may lose as much as one or two orders of magnitude in performance. On the other hand, creating optimal implementations requires the developer to have an understanding of algorithms, capabilities and limitations of compilers, and the target platforms architecture and microarchitecture. This interdisciplinary course introduces the student to the foundations and state-of-the-art techniques in high performance software development using important functionality such as linear algebra kernels, transforms, filters, and others as examples. The course will explain how to optimize for the memory hierarchy, take advantage of special instruction sets, and how to write parallel code for multicore, manycore, and cluster platforms, based on state-of-the-art research. Further, a general strategy for performance analysis and optimization is introduced that the students will apply in group projects that accompany the course. Finally, the course will introduce the students to the recent field of automatic performance tuning.      Prerequiste: Senior ECE or CS undergraduate student or higher, solid C programming skills.",

These interrelated activities form the backbone of a high-quality software solution that performs its function as intended.  VT is no longer considered an exclusively backend phase undertaken by a separate quality assurance unit, vulnerable to availability of discretionary resources near project end. Rather, VT is a cross-functional discipline applied throughout the software lifecycle from beginning to end. As such VT is an integral and essential part of any sensible software development process. This course introduces the students to concepts, principles, theory, types, tools, and techniques of VT with exposure to both modern, widely-applicable approaches and traditional, formal techniques. Students will acquire sufficient depth and breadth in VT through a balanced coverage of topics. The course syllabus spans fundamentals such as VT principles, systematic testing, input space analysis, and test coverage; practical strategies such as test-driven development, unit testing, and test design; and formal approaches such as abstraction, model checking, static analysis, and symbolic execution.

Integration of entire systems on one or a very small number of dies has made it possible to deploy hundreds of billions of end-points that will link the cyber world with the physical world.  At this scale, a key design requirement is that such devices can be handled at most once during their lifetime.  Batteries should be life-long, and reprogramming should be over-the-air.  How then should such devices be architected?  We begin by examining modern digital communications including modulation and coding schemes, basic RF subsystems and antennas.  We examine the computational structures that allow us to reduce communication to computation.  Anticipating that such devices will need to be highly programmable, we consider concepts from traditional computer architecture and their applicability to this energy-constrained domain. We also examine the rapid evolution of transducer technologies and how these are being integrated into SoCs.  Then, we consider how an architect can make tradeoffs across these domains to meet design objectives.  Students will take advantage of a purpose-built experimental platform called PowerDu that enables deep exploration of these topics in realistic applications. Background in computer architecture, signals and systems, and EM field theory is recommended.  Graduate standing is required to register for this course.",

The course will cover real-world practices for reliability, supplemented by case studies of large-scale downtime incidents. The concepts will be taught in the context of contemporary cloud-computing platforms, and the course will include a hands-on project that involves the design, implementation and empirical evaluation of a reliable distributed cloud-based system. Students will be taught to write, review, and present a conference-style research paper by the end of the semester, with the goal of documenting the design, lessons learned and experimental results of their team project.

Traditionally, signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms, while categorization and classification are achieved using statistical tools.     Machine learning aims to design algorithms that learn about the state of the world directly from data.     A increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning techniques to both aspects of signal processing, often blurring the distinction between the two.     This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.

Many traditional areas of computer science and computer engineering are impacted by the constraints and demands of mobility. Examples include network protocols, power management, user interfaces, file access, ergonomics, and security. This will be an advanced course in the truest sense --- most, if not all, the topics discussed will be ones where there is little consensus in the research community on the best approaches. The course will also offer significant hand-on experience in this area. Each student will have to present and lead the discussion on a number of papers. Students will work in groups of three under the guidance of a mentor on a hands-on project. Each student will also be required to write one of two documents: (a) a research proposal (similar in spirit to an NSF proposal) on an idea in mobile computing or (b) a short business plan for a commercial opportunity in mobile computing. Grading will be based on the quality of the presentations, the project, and the proposal or business plan.     Prerequisites: 15-410 and senior or graduate standing.",

        "desc": "This course provides students with the tools to understand patents and technology rights, and how these assets can be utilized in a firms innovation processes. Patents and other technology rights are increasingly valuable to businesses, and are no longer limited to large manufacturing or scientific companies. Start-ups and mid-sized firms in numerous industries use technology rights to increase their return on innovation and innovative activity. When used effectively, these legal tools can lead to significant and sometimes surprising business advantages. Patent rights can enable small companies to prevent copying by competitors, earn higher revenue from licensing technology, and compete more effectively against much larger firms. Knowledge of technology rights can provide a powerful competitive advantage and provide many nonintuitive  opportunities. In addition, these legal mechanisms can be made even more effective if they are integrated with the organizations innovation processes: the way that organizations manage the conception, development, and production of new products, services, technologies, and business models. This is in contrast to the more common practice of treating innovation and patenting as distinct and consecutive processes. Highly innovative organizations develop new products and technologies guided in part by the patents and other technology rights that can eventually enhance value. This course is believed to be unique in its focus on the complete innovation life cycle. It treats intangible assets like patents and business strategies as part of the process of developing innovations. This leads to interesting techniques different from those used by specialists who only create technology, or who only work with patent and other technology rights. Through the exercises and final project students will follow the complete life cycle of an actual product or service.",

We will begin with a historical and philosophical study of privacy and then explore recent public policy issues. We will examine the privacy protections provided by laws and regulations, as well as the way technology can be used to protect privacy. We will emphasize technology-related privacy concerns and mitigation, for example: social networks, smartphones, behavioral advertising (and tools to prevent targeted advertising and tracking), anonymous communication systems, big data, and drones. This is part of a series of courses offered as part of the MSIT-Privacy Engineering masters program. These courses may be taken in any order or simultaneously. Foundations of Privacy (Fall semester) offers more in-depth coverage of technologies and algorithms used to reason about and protect privacy. Engineering Privacy in Software (Spring semester) focuses on the methods and tools needed to design systems for privacy. This course is intended primarily for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students with some technical background. Programming skills are not required. 8-733, 19-608, and 95-818 are 12-unit courses for PhD students. Students enrolled under these course numbers will have extra assignments and will be expected to do a project suitable for publication. 8-533 is a 9-unit course for undergraduate students. Masters students may register for any of the course numbers permitted by their program. This course will include a lot of reading, writing, and class discussion. Students will be able to tailor their assignments to their skills and interests. However, all students will be expected to do some writing and some technical work.",

Courses are appropriate for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students. Students should read the detailed descriptions and contact course instructors regarding any pre-requisites required for the course. Section B1: In this course, commonly used mathematical models for power systems (linear approximations and convex relaxations) are employed to solve the optimal power flow, the unit commitment, the system planning, the state estimation and other similar optimality problems. Some software applications will be presented and examined practically. Section C1 This course is designed to prepare students for roles in the venture ecosystem, either as a venture capitalist, startup founder or management, or corporate partner to early-stage companies.  It addresses financing situations from the initial funding and capitalization of a company to the economics of the acquisition of the company.  In each situation, the trade-offs between the various parties - investors, management, and commercial partners - are considered.  Although the lens is frequently on early-stage technology companies, the principles and practices taught are often extensible to other small and mid-size businesses.",

        "desc": "This course provides students with the tools to understand patents and technology rights, and how these assets can be utilized in a firms innovation processes. Patents and other technology rights are increasingly valuable to businesses, and are no longer limited to large manufacturing or scientific companies. Start-ups and mid-sized firms in numerous industries use technology rights to increase their return on innovation and innovative activity. When used effectively, these legal tools can lead to significant and sometimes surprising business advantages. Patent rights can enable small companies to prevent copying by competitors, earn higher revenue from licensing technology, and compete more effectively against much larger firms. Knowledge of technology rights can provide a powerful competitive advantage and provide many nonintuitive  opportunities. In addition, these legal mechanisms can be made even more effective if they are integrated with the organizations innovation processes: the way that organizations manage the conception, development, and production of new products, services, technologies, and business models. This is in contrast to the more common practice of treating innovation and patenting as distinct and consecutive processes. Highly innovative organizations develop new products and technologies guided in part by the patents and other technology rights that can eventually enhance value. This course is believed to be unique in its focus on the complete innovation life cycle. It treats intangible assets like patents and business strategies as part of the process of developing innovations. This leads to interesting techniques different from those used by specialists who only create technology, or who only work with patent and other technology rights. Through the exercises and final project students will follow the complete life cycle of an actual product or service.",

With respect to actual innovation decision-making, the course will examine the various tools and techniques that are used by (1) corporations to make investment decisions in specific RD projects and (2) entrepreneurial organizations to make investments > decisions in new technical projects.   This course will address a number of commonly used decision tools such as:  (1) Discounting / Net Present Value calculations (NPV), IRR / Payback Period / ROIC / etc.; (2) Decision and Risk Analysis methodologies; and (3) Portfolio management  Finally, the course will develop an understanding of the differences between how corporations and how entrepreneurial firms use these tools, examine the implications of financial analysis techniques on RD decision-making, and will examine some of the suggested fallacies and the limitations of financial analysis of innovation management.",

This foundation forms the basis for exploring the formation of gaseous (oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and sulfur dioxide) and particulate pollutants in combustion systems. The course then describes combustion modifications for pollutant control and theories for pollutant removal from effluent streams. The internal combustion engine and utility boilers serve as prototypical combustion systems for discussion. The course also addresses the relationship between technology and the formulation of rational regional, national, and global air pollution control strategies. Cross listed 19-740, 19-440, 24-425",

Advances in materials and their processing are driving all technologies, including the broad areas of nano-, bio-, energy, and electronic (information) technology. Performance requirements for future applications require that engineers continue to design both new structures and new processing methods in order to engineer materials having improved properties. Applications such as optical communication, tissue and bone replacement, fuel cells, and information storage, to name a few, exemplify areas where new materials are required to realize many of the envisioned future technologies. This course provides an introduction to how science and engineering can be exploited to design materials for many applications. The principles behind the design and exploitation of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites are presented using examples from everyday life, as well as from existing, new, and future technologies. A series of laboratory experiments are used as a hands-on approach to illustrating modern practices used in the processing and characterization of materials and for understanding and improving materials properties.",

None of the most widely used metals are thermodynamically stable as metals under the conditions in which they are used. Consideration of how metals react in their service environments are critical for ensuring successful performance. In this class we will examine reactions at near-ambient temperature in the presence of water (corrosion) and at high temperatures in the presence of oxygen (oxidation). While fundamentally the same (the metal transforms to a stable oxide), the mechanism of these reactions are different. The applicability of this class covers a wide range of fields: structural steels, superalloys for power generation and transportation, stainless steel interconnects in fuel cells and batteries, biocompatibility of implants, to name a few. At the end of the class, students should be able to identify relevant thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena, describe the changes to microstructure and properties, and select/design appropriate materials for service in a variety of environments.",

Throughout the course, both traditional analytics techniques and scientific computing will be used to solve mechanical problems going from planetary systems, spring-based systems and nuclear scattering. Topics covered include Newtons Laws, microscopic models of solids, energy, energy quantization, mass-energy equivalence, multi particle systems, collisions, angular momentum including quantized angular momentum, kinetic theory of gases and statistical mechanics. Students are encouraged to do an optional research project that will be presented at a departmental poster session at the end of the semester.",

        "desc": "The study of astronomy has blossomed over the past few decades as a result of new ground-based and space-based telescopes, and with the advantage of fast computers for analysis of the huge quantities of data. As our astronomical horizon expands, we are still able to use the laws of physics to make sense of it all. This course is for students who want to understand the basic concepts in astronomy and what drives astronomical objects and the universe. The course emphasizes the application of a few physical principles to a variety of astronomical settings, from stars to galaxies to the structure and evolution of the universe. Introductory classical physics is required, but modern physics will be introduced as needed in the course. The course is intended for science and engineering majors as well as students in other disciplines with good technical backgrounds. Computer lab exercises will be used to gain practical experience in astronomical techniques. In addition, small telescopes are available for personal sign-out for those who would like to use them, and outdoor observing sessions will be organized as weather permits.",

The duality between wave-like and particle-like phenomena is introduced along with the deBroglie relations which link them. We develop a wave description appropriate for quanta which are partially localized and discuss the interpretation of these wavefunctions. The wave equation of quantum mechanics is developed and applied to the hydrogen atom from which we extrapolate the structure of the Periodic Table. Other materials-related applications are developed, for example, Boltzmann and quantum statistics and properties of electrons in crystals.

Elementary statistical mechanics is then introduced via the canonical ensemble to understand the interpretation of entropy in terms of probability and to calculate some thermodynamic quantities from simple models. These laws are applied to deduce relationships among heat capacities and other measureable quantities and then are generalized to open systems and their various auxiliary thermodynamic potentials; transformations between potentials are developed. Criteria for equilibrium of multicomponent systems are developed and applied to phase transformations and chemical reactions. Models of solutions are obtained by using statistical mechanics and are applied to deduce simple phase diagrams for ideal and regular solutions. The concept of thermodynamic stability is then introduced and illustrated in the context of phase transformations.",

This course will explore the underlying science behind nanotechnology, the tools used to create and characterize nanostructures, and potential applications of such devices. Material will be presented on a level intended for upper-level science and engineering students. The course will start with a brief review of the physical principles of electric fields and forces, the nature of chemical bonds, the interaction of light with matter, and elastic deformation of solids. Characterization using electron microscopy, scanning probe methods, and spectroscopic techniques will then be described in detail. Fabrication using top-down and bottom-up methods will be discussed, contrasting these approaches and providing examples of each. Nanotechnology methods will be compared  with those used in the modern micro-electronics industry. Finally, examples of nanoscale components and systems will be described, including quantum dots, self-assembled monolayers, molecular computing, and others. Stand-alone laboratory exercises will be included as an important element of the course. These will focus on the use of scanning probe methods to study the nm-scale structure and atomic forces involved in various nanostructures. Students will sign up for these laboratory sessions and perform the exercises under the supervision of a teaching assistant.    In addition to the prerequisites, students should have taken a prior laboratory course in a science or engineering department and should have some familiarity with differential equations at an elementary level.",

In this course, we will gradually develop an understanding of the geometries which are the solutions of the Einstein equation, with an emphasis on their relevance to physical situations.

        "desc": "This course is an introduction to learning how to make statistical decisions and reason with data.  The approach will emphasize thinking through an empirical problem from beginning to end and using statistical tools to look for evidence for/against an explicit argument/hypothesis.  Types of data will include continuous and categorical variables, images, text, networks, and repeated measures over time.  Applications will largely draw from interdisciplinary case studies spanning the humanities, social sciences, and related fields.  Methodological topics will include basic exploratory data analysis, elementary probability, hypothesis tests, and empirical research methods.  There is no calculus or programming requirement.  There will be one weekly computer lab for additional hands-on practice using an interactive software platform that allows student-driven inquiry.    This course is the credit-equivalent to 36-201 and will be honored appropriately as a pre-requisite for downstream Statistics courses.  As such, this course is not currently open to students who have received credit for 36-201, 36/70-207, 36-220, 36-247, or any 300- or 400-level Statistics course.",

In this course, methods for the analysis of categorical data are discussed with the purpose of learning how to apply them to data.

During the seminar, students will be presented with opportunities and experiences designed to help them frame how the MCS curriculum aspires to shape their evolving identities in the areas of scholar, person, professional and citizen, while also engendering a sense of excitement about science and scientific inquiry.  The seminar will offer information and strategies that are employed both by successful students and by successful scientists in optimizing their approach to work and life, with a key focus on areas such as cognitive learning skills, research, teamwork, goal setting, time management, innovation, community engagement, ethics, resources and assessment.  Additionally, the seminar will introduce first-year students to the learning outcomes and requirements associated with the MCS core curriculum, with a particular emphasis on the self-directed ENGAGE courses and the role of the e-portfolio system in documenting and framing student growth and development.",

        "desc": "Climate change is considered by many the most serious social, political, and environmental issue of the 21st century. As human activities increase the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, scientists have established the reality of climate change and have estimated its impacts on human society and the natural world. Despite the scientific consensus on its existence, causes, and consequences, a substantial number of Americans and citizens of other countries still question these conclusions and a small but vocal group of doubters continue to challenge the science and scientific consensus on climate change. In spite of some social division over these issues, governments at local, national, and international levels have made concerted efforts to craft policies to address climate change. These policies have shifted over time as the information, attitudes, and technology associated with climate change have evolved. In this course, we will explore the challenges and complexities of climate change by investigating the subject from a variety of angles: scientific, political, rhetorical, cultural, economic, technological, and ethical. Over the course of the semester, well inquire: What is climate change? How do scientists know it is happening? Why is there public debate over it? What solutions are available? And what are the pros and cons of the different solutions?",

How can we understand the information being transmitted? This class will cover the basic engineering and statistical tools in common use for analyzing neural spike train data, with an emphasis on hands-on application. Topics may include neural spike train statistics (Poisson processes, interspike intervals, Fano factor analysis), estimation (MLE, MAP), signal detection theory (d-prime, ROC analysis, psychometric curve fitting), information theory, discrete classification, continuous decoding (PVA, OLE), and white-noise analysis. Each topic covered will be linked back to the central ideas from undergraduate probability, and each assignment will involve actual analysis of neural data, either real or simulated, using Matlab. This class is meant for upper-level undergrads or beginning graduate students, and is geared to the engineer who wants to learn the neurophysiologists toolbox and the neurophysiologist who wants to learn new tools. Those looking for broader neuroscience application (eg, fMRI) or more focus on regression analysis are encouraged to take 36-746. Those looking for more advanced techniques are encouraged to take 18-699.

For each model class, after a survey of the relevant theory and solution methods, we will discuss problems in mathematical finance that are amenable to that problem class. Two of the main assignments in the course are team projects involving real data. These projects are simplifications of problems faced by practitioners. The first project is a bond portfolio construction for a pension fund. For the second project, several possible topics will be suggested. On the last day of classes some teams will present the highlights of their project in class.  The main reference for the course will be: Optimization Methods in Finance 2nd edition by G.

The valuation tools used to price these derivatives are Risk Neutral Valuation and Monte Carlo Simulation. The course also highlights practical issues about model calibration, model risk, and static and dynamic hedging. The highlight of the course is a series of in-class team case presentations. While pricing and hedging techniques are important, so too are practical issues such as deciding which risks to share contractually and knowing how to pitch a derivative deal.

        "desc": "This course presents a modern treatment of the buy side of quantitative finance.  The course is organized in three major parts.  In the first part, we will give a high-level discussion of asset management both from an academic and from a practical perspective.  Factor models play a central role in this high-level discussion.  Factors are associated to the drivers of asset returns.  Assets earn high returns (risk premiums) to compensate owners for the losses they incur during bad times, i.e., because of their exposure to underlying factor risks.  In the second part of the course, we will discuss specific risk factors for different asset classes that have been documented in academic research.  We will describe how to use statistical methods to validate the existence of premiums associated with these factors; how to construct portfolios based on underlying factor models for investors with different preferences and constraints; and how to back-test the performance of these portfolios.  In the third part of the course we will discuss performance evaluation and practical aspects related to transaction costs, liquidity, taxes, and cash management.  Students will complete a project based on the techniques covered in the course and present their results on the last day of classes.",

Building on the explorations of form and space in the 1st year, we investigate in greater depth the role that program, context, and the physical elements of architecture play in creating meaningful architecture.   We seek to understand design principles underlying the buildings of the past and present, from the broadly theoretical and conceptual, to the real implications of tectonics and sustainability, and apply these ideas with intent and significance.  We will focus on developing challenging architectural ideas, profound building details, and effective ways of communicating them in order to explore architectures potential for creating poetic expressions, appropriate shelter, or exalted experiences, as well as its ability to embody ideas and impart meaning to the world around us.",

The state of the art in building energy conservation and passive heating and cooling technologies will be presented, with take-home readings and assignments.   To stress the significance of architectural design decision-making on energy consumption and comfort, full design specifications and calculations will be completed for a residential-scale building.  Students will compile a professional energy consultants report, designing the most viable energy conservation retrofit measures for their client from siting, massing, organization, enclosure detailing, opening control, to passive system integration and management. An overview of world energy consumption in buildings and energy design standards will be challenged by lectures on building energy conservation successes, and emerging demands for a broader definition of sustainability.

A series of exercises sequence drawing, computer modeling, fabrication, and assembly in a recursive cycle through which students will learn to balance design, intuitive making, as well as material exploration.  The discourse between design and fabrication is shifting as the tools they are reliant upon become increasingly more sophisticated. Students will be challenged to strive towards a digital literacy that fosters a critical engagement with the technology, oscillating between virtual simulation and physical reality. Through a structured disposition of fabrication assignments, the nature of the tools will be exploited to rapidly produce and evaluate within an iterative design process.  This semester, we will study a selection of paintings by Charles-douard Jeanneret. Over the course of three projects, students will apply the concept of transparency, defined by Colin Rowe and Robert Slutzky, as an operative mean and utilize each of the computational tools at hand to exploit the spatial ambiguity in Le Corbusiers paintings - exploring the translation of two-dimensional compositions into three-dimensional spatial organizations.   Each project will focus on developing sensibilities specific to each machines affordances and allow those to inform the process of design, as well as representation. Similar to how Joseph Savina, a wood carver, created sculptures of Le Corbusiers paintings, students will be producing interpretive physical models of his formal relationships.",

Architects must draw from other disciplines, distinguish multiple positions on any issue, take a stance, act on, and be able to discuss, debate, and defend their ideas. The course will begin with the fundamental questions: What is theory in architecture? How has our understanding of architecture and theory evolved historically to get to this point? How will it continue to transform into the 21st century? Where is architecture going? Students will discover how architectural ideas and theories evolve and reoccur, and even the oldest theories have contemporary relevance. The topics covered will vary from year to year to acknowledge the dynamic nature of the program, profession, environment, and global context. The work of the seminar will focus on readings, weekly presentations and discussions about the sources, and a research paper on a theoretical aspect of architecture that might lead to a thesis or grant proposal.  Thanks for syllabi. For NAAB clarity, but also for optics, I will ask all my colleagues teaching required courses for the M.Arch to issue a separate syllabus with the correct course number, and if they want, slightly different language about expectations, attendance, etc. I will also ask all faculty teaching required courses to list in their syllabus the SPC that are being demanded in the course... so students and faculty are clear.",

To stress the significance of architectural design decision-making on energy consumption and comfort, full design specifications and calculations will be completed for a residential-scale building.  Students will compile a professional energy consultants report, designing the most viable energy conservation retrofit measures for their client from siting, massing, organization, enclosure detailing, opening control, to passive system integration and management. An overview of world energy consumption in buildings and energy design standards will be challenged by lectures on building energy conservation successes, and emerging demands for a broader definition of sustainability.

We will consider its potential to involve and collaborate with residents through urban data. These investigations are organized as a series of 5 modules. Each explores contemporary methods and workflows to leverage online data in the urban design process. The modules will introduce the means to collect and access data; tools, techniques, and context required for analysis and processing; and strategies and visualization techniques for data aggregation and synthesis.

It will explore design theories and practices responding to the so-called computer revolution, cybernetics, Artificial Intelligence, and the linked transformations on our conceptions of design, creativity, nature, body, and place. An aim of the course is to explore computation beyond particular technologies and tools, and to develop a critical understanding of a rapidly expanding landscape of hybrid practices, theories, and research methods linked to computational, tangible, and interactive forms of creative practice and expression.   The semester will be divided into two-week modules in which faculty in the Computational Design program participate as guests. In each module guests cover topics derived from their own research, including readings and a short team-based project expanding on the topic introduced. The class thus introduces different approaches to the research and practice of computation in the creative fields at Carnegie Mellon. Topics include paradigms such as shape grammars, tangible interaction, machine learning, rule-based systems, responsive environments, and architectural robotics, among others.   The course will also provide an introduction to academic research, in particular to the elements and structure of an effective research paper. Participants practice reading and responding to both seminal documents and contemporary research related to the topics introduced in class.",

The course explores core urban design methods and theories organized into ten themes that progressively move through the urban design process, exploring key techniques, theoretical underpinnings and  historical examples. The first half focuses on approaches to analyzing the city, followed by the identification of goals and the framing of design opportunities. The second half explores a range of design methods and approaches, ending with an exploration of utopian ideals in urban design. The course holds as a basic tenet the notion that urban design is best examined at multiple scales: urban and suburban form, the structure of neighborhoods and blocks, infrastructure and landscape,and typologies of public spaces, streets and buildings. Also central to the approach is a belief that urban design should strive to act in the public interest, negotiating the often conflicting needs and desires of a range of actors in the urban landscape to work towards positive social and ecological outcomes. A wide variety of theoretical texts and methodologies are examined with a focus on the postmodern period during which the contemporary manifestation of the discipline emerged. Assignments include readings from seminal urban design texts, participating and leading reading discussions, and a three-part written and graphic project.",

In this pursuit the objectives of this course are: 1) outline and discuss the established theoretical constructs of the subject; 2) demonstrate the dynamic nature of construction projects stemming from inherent uncertainties; and 3) hone students adaptability to the dynamism while conducting construction projects. This course will include both discussions on assigned readings and a studio based group project. The assigned readings would include chapters from recommended books and peer-reviewed journal and conference papers. It will be expected that students critique and deliberate on these readings on an online forum created by the instructor. In order to provide a real world experience to the students the second half of the semester will focus on development of a construction project with varying scenarios such as changes in resources and scope creep.",

Emphasis will be placed on careful consideration of digital mediums and developing a sense of craft related to digital modeling in the hope that students will become conscientious makers and consumers of digital content. Students will be encourage to understand and apply algorithmic problem solving to the many design constraints encountered in architecture. The course will explore the relationship of parametric workflows to design thinking and will situate contemporary trends in a broader framework of computational design. The course will also forefront complex form-making as a response to bio-mimicry, systems thinking, and mass-customization.  Rather than positioning parametric modeling as a disruption of historical architectural design process, the course will encourage students to consider how new tools might augment the disciplines historical commitments to orthographic projection, perspectival drawing, and physical modeling.",

The course is organized within the framework of the US Green Building Councils Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Rating Systems, which contains rating system prerequisites and credits in the following categories: location  transportation, site, water, energy, materials, and the interior environmental quality. Within that framework, we explore strategies promoted within LEED (and the new WELL standard) and compare/contrast them with strategies in the rating systems of other countries. We also consider the design of the rating system itself, its implementation, and the national context in which the system was created.  The course is designed to develop your understanding of, and hone your critical thought about, sustainable building design and operation. Class lectures address the concepts and environmental issues underlying rating system requirements and credits; present multiple strategies for improved building performance; and to the extent possible, address the impact of specific rating systems and strategies. Students are then challenged to apply this information to specific locations  issues, based on the environmental/energy issues associated with the rating system categories listed above.  Although the course provides a foundation for taking USGBCs LEED Green Associate and/or LEED Accredited Professional exam, it is not an exam prep course. Students who successfully complete the course will understand a range of impacts that buildings may have on the environment and on building occupants, will have insights into contextual aspects of sustainability, and will be familiar with a range of strategies that may be used to encourage development of better buildings and communities.",

The relationship among design, product development, and business is explored with class projects, readings, discussions, and the analysis of artifacts and process.   Additionally, students experience the use of traditional design skills (drawing, mockups, and model making) in the visualization and representation of design concepts and solutions. Techniques include: 1.     Conducting observational research, 2.     Analyzing information to inform team brainstorming, 3.     Planning projects, 4.     Developing concept strategies, 5.     Generating ranges of solutions 6.     Selecting and refining concepts   Methods of early prototyping and testing through the use of interactive and experiential mock-ups are emphasized.

        "desc": "Driven by the combination of increased access to data, computational power, and improved algorithms, data science and artificial intelligence technologies have become mainstream.  These technologies include machine learning, natural language and speech processing, expert systems. robotics, and vision. Historically, early programs applying these capabilities were designed to operate on their own, on very narrow tasks, based on pre-programmed knowledge. Today, we have the ability to design human-computer systems in which both human and computers act intelligently, adapt to the world and learn from experience, improving their performance over time.  How do we design such collaborative systems, taking advantage of the fundamentally different ways in which humans and computers act and learn? How do we build smart systems that achieve their intended goals, with a minimum of unintended side effects?  The mini-course will give students the opportunity to address such questions. After an introduction of some basic concepts and techniques in AI and data science (only a basic familiarity with statistics is assumed), the course illustrates both the potential and current limitations of these techniques with examples from a variety of applications.  We spend some time on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of human decision-making and learning, specifically in combination with AI systems.  Exercises will include close examination of the inputs and outputs of various technologies with the goal of learning to select appropriate technologies for a given problem and anticipate design implications. Each student will also complete a final project that takes a project from start to finish (framing the problem, choosing data sources, exploratory data analysis, basic modeling, communicating results).

We will explore these topics in the context of the Creation Phase - focusing on founding a new start-up and raising seed funding; and the Scaling Phase - focusing on growing a venture where startups typically undergo B, and C rounds of funding; We will examine common mistakes and misconceptions in starting a new entrepreneurial business, and meet entrepreneurs, angel investors, and venture capitalists from Silicon Valley to learn, first hand, the challenges of conceiving, creating, and growing a new venture.    In the second part of the IE course, our focus will be on the Consolidation Phase ? when growing ventures evolve into established global corporations We will examine critical pain points facing this group of companies, the impact of organizational complexity, the challenge of managing a multi-business enterprise, and expanding the global footprint. This is the phase when technology companies find it more challenging to innovate and often shift their growth focus to searching for acquisitions. Invited guests will share their experiences and lessons learned, and give us a first-hand perspective on realities facing this critical group of innovative companies.

We will begin by exploring the nature of having an experience, followed by the broad philosophy of design in relationship to other areas of human activity, the sciences and the arts. We will explore design through its orders of activity: first in communication and second the creation of physical objects. But design has a far greater reach into the intangible and more complex areas of human activity: interaction, systems, environments, and culture. These are the topics of inquiry for design and, unlike what the patchwork of professions would have you believe, are not fixed by boundaries. Design is enormously broad and something everybody participates in as we create the artificial world in which we live. Those who call themselves designers have greater power in shaping this world and for that reason we will end the course with a discussion of ethics. Non-Design majors are welcome.",

Rhythm, texture and composition are achieved through routine, elementary exercises using geometric forms, demanding concentration and manual discipline with the development of hand-eye coordination. The function, use, and harmonious sequencing of letterforms is taught through weekly projects. Awareness of rhythm, texture and letterform structure is achieved through routine exercises. Drills, demonstrations, discussions, individual and class critiques are on-going. Additional related topics and activities introduced in class include books: binding and design. A brief introduction to the historical development of our Western alphabet is provided through film, slides, demonstrations, with discussion of twentieth-century type designs. Students also gain exposure to letter vocabulary, paleography, monoprints, words and punctuation, classical page design, publication design-past and present, and calligraphys role in design today. Thinking with hands and eyes, the manual placement and spacing of letters practiced in this course awakens sensitivity and judgment in the designer.",

You will be required to use your traditional and contemporary design skills, and the method of Foresight, to conduct quality speculative thinking and gather meaningful insights from future users that lead to valuable design proposals. Truly addressing complex challenges requires expertise across many multidisciplinary domains of practice, therefore, the course work is team based. This is intended to provide you more of an interdisciplinary learning experience that allows, and requires, you to contribute, negotiate and collectively construct and present compelling well-reasoned arguments to the challenge given leveraging your disciplinary orientations to design - products, communications, environments (P,C,E).",

Thinking of designed technologies in relation to different models and ways of seeing and thinking about the word we live in is crucial for practitioners involved in any kind of change through technological interventions, whether at the level of technology production, or deployment, or policy. This mini course introduces students to designerly approaches using systems theory. It aims to sensitize them to a range of different ways to frame and think about systems and expose them to a range of specific systems thinking techniques and terminologies for analyzing complex natural, socio-cultural and technological phenomena and making evaluable changes to those phenomena. As a result, by the end of the course students will expect to have developed a better sense of where and how to effect interventions and gauge the effects and impacts of those interventions.",

        "desc": "This seminar is an exploration of the leading edge of current interaction design practice. Most of these new developments reflect the conflicting ways in which the work of interaction designers is expanding in scope whilst also speeding up. This necessitates that designers understand more non-design domains of knowledge, for instance, in relation to domains of cultural difference, organizational change, business strategy, risk management. It also demands that designers pay more attention to processes and organizations - their own as professional designers, but also those of their clients and stakeholders. And it requires that interaction designers have a better understanding of their profession within wider socio- economic transformations. The course will involve a range of readings with participants required to develop public positions on emerging design practice trends. To this end, the course will teach multi-modal social media communication techniques. It will also involve developing research-based strategies for helping complex organizations in transition.",

Students will learn the fundamental components and features of game engines (such as objects, inputs, movement, interactions, physics, UI, artwork and animation, sound, and more) and the terminology and theory behind them. Students will attend lectures and participate in example exercises to illustrate these concepts, and put these concepts to practice in their assignment work.  This course does not have pre-requisites, but a basic understanding of common code concepts (variables, loops, conditional statements) is recommended.",

Each generate spatial experiences that hold varying levels of immersion that can enhance or replace our perception of the real world, and each bring their own advantages and limitations.  With consumer-grade XR devices now readily available, video game companies are starting to generate content but are faced with the challenge of designing for mediums for which very few standards exist. The class will seek to better understand these technologies, examining the features that differentiate these platforms as well as their capabilities and limitations, and exploring the methods and techniques that trick our brains into believing these environments to be real.  Students will play games and explore apps released for these platforms, dissecting them to discover best practices for designing content for users.  Students will apply these learnings by creating brand new XR content.  Course work will be performed in collaborative, cross-disciplinary teams as students form their own game studios to tackle design challenges and create games of their very own. These teams will engage in hands-on development for XR platforms, and will have roles for artists, programmers, designers, producers and more. Students from all disciplines are encouraged to join.",

The class will focus on the importance of creating the total guest experience.  Discussions on story and storytelling will address the different aspects of both franchise and original stories.    The class will also examine the role of architecture and technology and how they are crafted to enhance the overall guest experience. The importance of communication and collaboration across all disciplines and the high professional standards required in every phase in the entertainment industry will be explored.   The process of managing creativity, risking taking, fostering a culture of team support and trust, developing presentation skills and providing valuable peer-review will all be part of the curriculum. Students will individually complete a variety of short assignment, research and presentations.   Students will also work in teams made up of various disciplines and backgrounds.  Assignments will include evaluation of experiences in existing theme parks; proposing a concept for a ride or experience deriving inspiration from a list of options provided by faculty; and developing a design project such as an expansion to an existing theme park, a new restaurant, hotel or other architecture added to an existing complex, a new event or attraction which would include a water, sound and light spectacle or a large scale ?Disney? parade event.   Students and faculty will jointly choose design assignments based on the needs, interest and composition of the class.  The constantly evolving nature of the industry will provide opportunities for topics of discussion which will be identified by both faculty and students.",

The course will cover world building, environmental design, non-linear storytelling, and related topics. Students will use modeling tools, paint tools, sound processing tools, and the Unity game engine in conjunction with cutting-edge interface hardware. At the end of the semester, we hold an exhibition on campus to show class projects to the Carnegie Mellon community. The goal of the course is to take students with varying talents, backgrounds, and perspectives and put them together to do what they couldnt do alone.   The course is primarily for ETC graduate students, but occasionally other students are admitted by special permission from the instructors. To enroll, students must have ONE of the following skills: 3D modeling, high quality 2D art skills,strong programming skills, or the ability to compose and record original music and/or sound effects. The key is that there are no idea people in the course; everyone must share in the mechanical creation of the worlds. Students in the course may be assigned to a role that is not their primary skill set due to the distribution of the enrollees. This is a hands-on course and it takes a lot of time, but most students find it very fulfilling and fun. Note that we dont try to teach artists to program, or engineers to paint; we form teams where everyone does what theyre already skilled at to attack a joint project. Class time includes a split between regular lectures, display/critique of group projects, guest lectures and workshops designed to aid in world creation. Significant out-of-classroom time is required at the ETC working with your group, and non-ETC students must be sure to contact the faculty before the semester begins to get clarity on what time in class will be required.",

Is a show like Bodyguard reinforcing negative stereotypes about Muslim people or challenging the way that terrorism is viewed the U.K.? If its a problem for Scarlett Johansson to play a Japanese character in Ghost in the Shell, is it also problematic that David Oyelowoa black Britplays Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma? These are just a few of the sorts of questions we will be asking in this class. We ask these questions not to put down other artists, but to seriously interrogate our own views of representation. In addition to analyzing representation of race/ethnicity in film, TV, and theatre, students will write scenes and (ultimately) one-act plays that incorporate characters from multiple racial identity backgrounds. We are just now at a point in the United States where people of color are being given more space to tell their own stories; this is only the beginning of the process of dismantling stereotypical representations of race. In a diverse nation and a diverse world, we need to better understand one anotherthis class will act as a step in that process.   Section B: Playwrights study historic plays to learn the craft of writing. What is lacking in our education as writers because women are missing from our intellectual heritage? In this course we will explore a sampling of the many and diverse female writers who have been left out of the canon. Readings of plays and feminist texts will guide us as we develop our craft as writers and seek a clearer understanding of historical female playwrights: what did they write? Why did history choose not to remember them? What can we gain as writers and theater-makers from remembering them now?  Students will write in class every week and will also bring three original short plays, inspired by classic texts, to share in class.",

Like all Dramatic Literature classes, these are academically rigorous, requiring some amount of intensive critical reading and writing. Registration for this course is limited to Drama majors:  (Arons) Contemporary Women Playwrights - in this course we will read, discuss, and analyze a range of works written by women in the last twenty years. Well read plays by writers like Sarah Ruhl, Kia Corthron, Lynn Nottage, Madeleine George, Young Jean Lee, Jennifer Haley, Lauren Gunderson, Ann Washburn,  ... and more We will explore their works through in-class discussion, reaction papers, and presentations and activities.  (Amodei) Critical Theory and Performance: What is critical theory? In this introductory class, we will investigate how the frameworks and methodologies derived from theories are useful in discussing and making art. The goal of this class will be for students to learn the skills necessary to engage with the larger theoretical discussions bound up with contemporary drama and art. This will be achieved through a blend of reading, writing, discussion and artmaking. Topics include: Postdramatic Theater, Queer Theory, Marxism and its inheritors, Performance Studies, Modernism-to-Postmodernism, Precarity, Land Art and Failure. Some authors we will cover are: Walter Benjamin, Adrian Piper, Theodore Adorno, Judith Butler, Isabell Lorey and Jos Esteban Muoz.

Directors, designers, actors, and dramaturgs work in groups to generate original ideas, images, texts, and material in a workshop environment. These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations.  The emphasis is on process, not product -- devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development -- both of which are explored here.    We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included:  Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more.  Students learn to define and distinguish these artists approaches through viewing video excerpts, readings, and discussion.   This class is an opportunity to explore avenues outside of traditional production modes and beyond each students individual discipline. We focus on the process of creating a theatrical language which truly integrates disciplines.",

Throughout the course, students are required to complete several projects and create musical compositions in styles of their own  choosing. The student is not graded on the musicality of these compositions, but instead on how well they meet the stated project goals by correctly using specific equipment and/or computer programs.    This is a self-paced version of 57-101. Material will be covered during weekly class sessions, though students are expected to make time in the evenings or weekends to work on their projects in either the MTC (MM119A) or some other cluster. Students with prior experience may pass out of certain classes and projects by providing teacher with equivalent work (pending teacher approval).

        "desc": "The Duchampian attack on traditional aesthetic categories has been the engine behind the distinctive shifts in postwar art. Photography, performance, conceptual proposals, installation art, film, video, and appropriations from mass culture play an equal part in contemporary visual culture. Duchamps attack on art as an institution set the tone for other anti-modernist projects to follow which did not accept the white cube of the gallery as their sole exhibition space (or measured worth as an artist). His notions of indifference, (critique of aesthetic judgment), reproducibility, simulation, performativity, artist-as-curator, and interactivity between the spectator and the work of art set the stage for a host of innovative explorations by artists ranging from the Combines of Robert Rauschenberg to the Mod-Spaceships of Mariko Mori. This seminar examines a tumultuous period in contemporary art and culture from 1960 to the mid-eighties, with special excursions into the aesthetics of commodification, phenomenology, materialism, conceptualism, semiotics, abjection, and technology. The impact of social movements and American foreign policies (i.e. Vietnam, Civil Rights, The Womens Movement, Globalism, the Aids Crisis) on the production and reception of contemporary art will also be examined.

        "desc": "This is an intermediate level course in creative coding, interactive new-media art, and computational design. Ideal as a second course for students who have already had one semester of elementary programming (in any language), this course is for you if youd like to use code to make art, design, architecture, and/or games -- AND youre already familiar with the basics of programming, such as for() loops, if() statements, and arrays.   This course satisfies the EMS-2 (60-210: Interactivity) requirement for BFA and BXA-Art majors. As with EMS-2, students in this course will develop an understanding of the contexts, tools, and idioms of software programming in the arts. Unlike EMS-2, this course additionally satisfies the computing portal requirement for CFA and Dietrich students pursuing IDeATe minors and concentrations. (Students with no prior programming experience should register instead for 15-104, 15-110, or 15-112.)  This is a studio art course in computer science, in which the objective is art and design, but the medium is student-written software. The course develops skills and understanding of text-based, imperative programming techniques in a variety of popular open-source arts-engineering toolkits, including p5.js (JavaScript), Processing (Java), and openFrameworks (C++), with the aim of applying such skills to interactive art and design, information visualization, generative media, and other creative cultural practices.   Rigorous programming exercises will develop the basic vocabulary of constructs that govern static, dynamic, and interactive form. Topics include the computational manipulation of: point, line and shape; texture, value and color; time, change and motion; reactivity, connectivity and feedback; interactive graphics, sound, and simulation; and the incorporation of various modes of input (sensors, cameras) and multimedia output.",

Some students may already have an interest in independently created audio-visual art. This class has plenty of room for those pursuits as well.   In addition to studying historical and contemporary music videos we will watch and discuss scenes from movie musicals and consider the work of artists and filmmakers whose works explore connections between the visual and aural senses. Our analyses will include form, content, and the socio-economic conditions of music video production and the changing conditions of production and viewing.   Music videos function simultaneously as artistic creations and promotional tools. They are a force in popular culture and have become essential to the promotion and consumption of popular music.

Technologists, artists, and designers are engaging in new, interdisciplinary modes to consume, create, and reuse media. To do this, they thoughtfully collaborate and critically reflect on media creation, distribution, participation, interaction, and how media affects the audience. In this course, students will challenge themselves to work in these new modal contexts by thinking critically in a genre of exploration. They will formulate the intent of their creative work, articulate relationships to art/design practice and theory, and respond insightfully to creative, media-rich outcomes. The class will introduce core concepts through foundational texts, in-class exercises, collaborative projects, and group critique. Through hands-on media exploration, students will ground concepts such as embodiment, emergence, composition, participatory interfaces, and mediated experiences. Section A will be an Introduction to Textile Media. Section B, will be an Introduction to Mediascapes: 2D to 3D Spatial Environments. Section C will be an Introduction to Digital Storytelling + Archives. For more detail on these sections, please visit https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/62-150",

Core competencies will be developed through modeling projects and software intensive labs, while a broader critical framework for conceiving of contemporary and historical parametric practices will be encouraged through periodic lectures. Emphasis will be placed on careful consideration of digital mediums and developing a sense of craft related to digital modeling in the hope that students will become conscientious makers and consumers of digital content. Students will be encourage to understand and apply algorithmic problem solving to the many design constraints encountered in architecture. The course will explore the relationship of parametric workflows to design thinking and will situate contemporary trends in a broader framework of computational design. The course will also forefront complex form-making as a response to bio-mimicry, systems thinking, and mass-customization.  Rather than positioning parametric modeling as a disruption of historical architectural design process, the course will encourage students to consider how new tools might augment the disciplines historical commitments to orthographic projection, perspectival drawing, and physical modeling.",

Despite the scientific consensus on its existence, causes, and consequences, a substantial number of Americans and citizens of other countries still question these conclusions and a small but vocal group of doubters continue to challenge the science and scientific consensus on climate change.   In spite of some social division over these issues, governments at local, national, and international levels have made concerted efforts to craft policies to address climate change. These policies have shifted over time as the information, attitudes, and technology associated with climate change have evolved. In this course, we will explore the challenges and complexities of climate change by investigating the subject from a variety of angles: scientific, political, rhetorical, cultural, economic, technological, and ethical. Over the course of the semester, we will inquire: What is climate change? How do scientists know it is happening? Why is there public debate over it? What solutions are available? And what are the pros and cons of the different solutions?",

        "desc": "In 1965 British mathematician I.J. Good wrote, An ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an intelligence explosion, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.  As we enter an age where companies like Uber are testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and innovative interfaces like IBMs Watson can play Jeopardy and learn techniques for medical diagnoses, how are we to negotiate an intelligence explosion that for many individuals might threaten the very notions of what it means to be human?  The future of human-to-machine relationships will likely define our historical epoch and yet, many young technologists and humanists underestimate the downstream impact of technological innovations on human society.  Presently, we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question.  This seminar will attend to the challenge of contemporary existential questions on what it means to be human (read not machine) in the context of a rapidly advancing technological age.  We will consider human narratives throughout history that exam how governments and individual citizens defined humanity in the context of slavery and colonialism as a framework for exploring and projecting what it means to be human in the age of rapidly advancing intelligent machines.  We will trace the technological advancements of the recent five decades and identify historical precedents and speculative narratives that help us to consider issues like labor, economic disparity, negotiations of power, human dignity and ethical responsibility within the context of human relations with advancing technological tools that are now coined, artificial intelligence.",

The decision to outsource software services to providers in distant places has many risks and thus careful management of critical success factors is essential.  Likewise, products and services are being developed and delivered by teams of people in diverse locations working together. Management of these sourcing models and human capital relationships will be an increasingly important skill for students expecting to fully participate in the emerging IS marketplace of the 21st century.  This course introduces the effective fundamentals of global project management and the mechanics of sourcing arrangements including offshore outsourcing.  Students will also examine the effects of human diversity and cross-cultural considerations in the creation, use and management of information systems.",

Like archaeological remnants, data, by its very nature, is a marker of what happened in the past. How can data be used to better understand this past and what is happening in the present?  How can data be leveraged to forecast what will happen in the future? Better still, how can data be used to mold what should happen in the future? In this course we will study descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods by which data can be used to gain insight and inform actions of people and organizations.  The real excitement of data science is in the doing.  This is an application oriented course requiring skill in algorithmic problem solving. We will use Python based data science tools.  While prior programming experience with Python will be helpful the course will strive to be self-contained.  If you have not programmed in Python before, you need to be comfortable programming in some language (e.g., Ruby, R, Java, C++) and will need to come up to speed with the Pythonic way of problem solving.",

Mathematical optimization techniques have been applied for decades in the context of logistics, supply chain management, and strategic planning, with great success. In recent years, the application of mathematical optimization has penetrated, and in some cases (re-)defined, many other areas such as the (financial) service industry, analytical marketing, health care, and web-based businesses. In this course, the most important methods and techniques underlying mathematical optimization are studied. These include linear programming, integer programming, and nonlinear programming as basic mathematical methodologies. Based on these, we also consider methodologies for particular problem classes such as network models and traveling salesman problems. During the course we will emphasize mathematical modeling, that is, creating a mathematical description that reflects a given practical problem described in words. Motivated by these mathematical models, we then discuss the necessary mathematical techniques for finding optimal solutions. Lastly, we consider the solution of these problems using optimization software, i.e., we represent the mathematical models in Excel and use Excel Solver to compute an optimal solution.",

Teams have emerged as a favorite work arrangement for such ongoing activities as developing new products, providing professional services, and starting new businesses.  Temporary groups are frequently assembled for a multitude of purposes, such as making difficult decisions, solving cross-functional problems, generating ideas, or performing unique tasks.  Indeed, groups and teams can be found at every level of the organization, from production crews on the shop floor to top management teams in the executive suite.  Moreover, advances in communication technology have created the potential for people who are dispersed across the globe to collaborate virtually, creating many new opportunities and challenges for leaders of such teams.  Teams are not a panacea, however.  Even as they become a way of life in many organizations, widespread myths and misconceptions about teams often stand in the way of effective teamwork.  At their worst, teams sometimes create more problems than they solve.  The core content of the course is a series of team and group exercises, case analyses, and readings. The exercises are framed and analyzed in terms of readings, lecture, and in-depth class discussions.  Much of the learning that occurs in the course will involve exercises, simulations, and cases that draw on students current experiences in the class as well as their previous experiences in teams and organizations outside of this class.",

Therefore, finance also describes the investment decisions of households and the resulting allocation of the economys resources across firms and time. This course is the introductory finance course in the undergraduate business program. The main topics covered in the course are Financial Markets, Net Present Value, The Objective of the Firm, Discounted Cash Flow, Portfolio Theory and the Cost of Capital, The Efficient Markets Hypothesis, The Capital Structure of the Firm, and Business Valuation. Time permitting, the course will also provide an introduction to option markets and derivative securities. Upon completing the course a student will be able to consider a large and complex business problem, make some assumptions, structure the firms cash flows in a spreadsheet, calculate the value of different solutions to the problem, and make a decision.",

This class looks at funding from the funders point of view and provides the student with a framework of the investment process: investment criteria, sourcing, selection, due diligence, deal structure, valuation, post investment involvement. Real companies seeking funding are used for the final project in which students will be expected, as investment teams, to make investment decisions and convince their fellow investors (the class) to join them (or not).

Instead of discussing pricing in isolation, we focus on the interplay between pricing and other aspects of marketing, such as positioning, branding and advertising. To this end, we provide a formal treatment of pricing concepts in the framework of game theory. Finally, we also discuss non-pricing tools that firms can use in order to capture customer value. Specifically, we cover cases wherein firms generate a profit while keeping their services free, a phenomena that is widely observed among Internet firms. This course has no formal prerequisite, but a willingness to study formal (i.e., mathematical) models is assumed. Any previous exposure to microeconomics analysis and game theory will be helpful.",

        "desc": "Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) is a strategic business process used to plan, develop, execute, and evaluate coordinated, measurable, persuasive brand communication programs over time with consumers, customers, prospects, and other targeted, relevant external and internal audiences. (source: Don Schultz).  IMC is specifically designed to ensure that all communication strategies and messages are unified and integrated across all channels and, importantly, begin with the consumer/customer.  It is critical that marketers understand the limitations of marcom tactics as well as how to best leverage and integrate marcom tactics for the strongest, most consistent and authentic brand voice in the targeted marketplace.  The entire IMC process is driven by the customer, and in the case of our discussions in this class, the consumer.   The course is designed to help students understand the integrated marketing communications model, the strategy and tools of the marketing mix and what makes an iconic brand.  The course is designed in five sections:  Part One focuses on understanding brands - iconic brands, terminology and types of branding.  Part Two focuses on the understanding of consumer behavior - one of the, if not the most critical part of understanding marketing.  Brands are built and defined in the minds of consumers.     Part Three focuses on IMC and the framework used by brand management to develop strategy, and understand audience segmentation and brand positioning to drive IMC.    Part Four focuses on understanding the IMC tactics available to marketers including advertising, social media and digital marketing, events and public relations.     Part five concludes with the deeper study of an iconic brand.",

The course emphasizes reading comprehension strategies for reading a variety of text types in English (e.g., journalism, textbook selections, popular press arguments, and academic journal articles). Throughout the semester, students use these sources to write summaries and short position papers. The course introduces students to readers expectations for North American rhetorical style at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels.  Within the course we discuss explicit genre and linguistic norms for writing in academic English so that writers can connect with their readers.  Students who take this course qualify through an online placement test that is administered through the university prior to the fall semester. (All sections are offered MWF).  Each 76-100 course is structured by the reading and writing objectives of the course as well as a vocabulary for writing in English, but some courses present different themes (or content) in their readings.",

        "desc": "Interpretation and Argument is a foundational, inquiry-driven writing course that introduces students to a variety of strategies for making compositional decisions in writing and communication. Within the course, students learn genre-based skills applicable to a variety of different fields. Students use a comparative genre analysis method to learn how to use models to take on new writing tasks, including an academic research proposal and a research article that contributes to an ongoing academic conversation. Faculty who teach 76-101 typically select texts, ranging from scholarly texts, journalism, and film, about an issue so that students can identify interesting questions for their own research projects. Students should expect explicit, research-based instruction, practice, and reflection to build knowledge in controlling their writing processes and writing clear, well-supported, reader-oriented arguments. Because the course emphasizes the real stakes of communicating with readers and listeners, students share with their peers both low and high stakes written work within an interactive and collaborative classroom environment. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

Within the course, we will discuss texts and evidence from multiple perspectives. We will examine how literary and cultural scholars write about texts (defined broadly), how they make claims, provide reasoning, and use textual support to argue for particular ways of seeing cultural objects. Throughout the semester, students will draw upon prior strategies and develop new ones for close reading and for critical analysis in order to produce their own thesis-driven arguments about why texts matter. We will consider and write about the extent to which these reading strategies are relevant for other kinds of reading and analysis by comparing texts from a variety of different disciplinary contexts.",

This course (one of two minis students can choose to fulfill their FYW requirement) focuses upon interpreting and making arguments using mainly numerical data but also qualitative data. We will look at research in a range of disciplinesincluding psychology, education, medicine, engineering, and the sciencesand note how writers select and analyze the data they collect. We will also examine what happens to this research when it is picked up by the popular media. Students will also practice collecting and analyzing their own data and reporting it to suit the needs of various stakeholders. There are two primary audiences for this section. Students in data-driven majors will find the section useful preparation for communicating in their disciplines. Students in other fields will learn how to critique and respond to the many ways that numbers shape our lives. This section presumes a basic ability to calculate averages, percentages, and ratios, but no advanced mathematical or statistical preparation. Instead, this section provides a fascinating look at how numbers and words intersect to create persuasive arguments in academic, professional, and popular contexts. Students will compare and analyze texts that make arguments with data, practice rhetorical strategies for synthesizing and representing data so that by the end of the class, students will apply these strategies to write an original data-driven research proposal.",

Most of the problems we encounter require careful investigation and research so that we might propose solutions that connect with others to make change. In this 76101 class (one of two minis students can choose to fulfill their FYW requirement), we will learn how public problems are defined and argued across a range of texts, including proposals, op-ed genres, and white papers. By analyzing a range of proposal texts, we will identify the different kinds of legwork necessary to write a successful proposal, arguably one of the most challenging aspects of writing a persuasive recommendation for change. We will examine how writers unpack problems rhetorically and use evidence to argue solutions for different stakeholders who may not share common values. We will learn strategies for evaluating and synthesizing data from existing research to use in a proposal argument. By the end of the course, students will write their own proposal that recommends a solution and a feasible plan for solving a real problem.",

        "desc": "Reading the classics appears to clash with our fast-paced rhythm of life, which seldom affords long periods of time or the spaciousness for ancient literature. It also contradicts the eclecticism and diversity of our contemporary culture. However, in this course we will take the opportunity to read ancient Greek epics, plays, poems, and histories that have exerted a peculiar influence on Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, and James Joyce, as well as on literature and culture today. Readings for this course could include Sappho (Fragments), Homer (Odyssey; in a new translation from Emily Wilson), Euripides (Hippolytus; Medea), Aeschylus (Oresteia), Aristophanes (Lysistrata), Plato (Symposium; Euthyphro), or portions of Herodotus (Histories), Thucydides (History of the Peloponnesian War), and Plutarch (Lives). Throughout, we will pay special attention to issues of gender, sexuality, and politics in the ancient world, and historically situate and contextualize texts with readings from Martha C. Nussbaum (Sex and Social Justice), David Halperin (Before Sexuality), Mary Beard (Women  Power), and others. Lastly, debates about the value of the classics also involve charges of presentism, or the claim that we anachronistically read ourselves into the classics. We will investigate the strategic value and/or dangers of doing so, and entertain new possibilities for telling, or retelling, ancient stories for modern lives. This course is a reading-intensive seminar, and it includes assignments such as discussion posts and replies, reading quizzes, short essays, and exams.",

Our main focus is the narrative fiction film, but we will also discuss documentaries, avant-garde work and animation.  The central organizing principle is historical, but there are a number of recurring thematic concerns.  These include an examination of the basic principles of filmmaking, the development of film technology, the definition of film as both art and business, and the history of film as an object of critical and cultural study.  The goals of this course are threefold.  First, it will provide you with a solid grounding in the key issues and concepts of film studies.  Second, it will expand your ability to knowledgeably critique individual cinematic works and their relationship to the larger culture.  Lastly, it will provide you with experience in expressing your critiques in essay form.  Most films will be viewed during the mandatory, weekly class screening, though several films will be assigned for viewing outside of class (in addition to readings and written assignments).",

        "desc": "Sometime around the late sixteenth century, enterprising cultural producers in early modern London began to develop a new commercial venture called playing: a business that offered ordinary people a few hours of dramatic entertainment for the price of one penny. In addition to watching the professional players onstage, spectators also participated in a form of play themselves, in a sense, because theatrical experience provided a unique opportunity to engage imaginatively with otherwise inaccessible people, worlds, and ideas. More than four hundred years later, the drama of the period now ranks among the most esteemed texts in all English literature, and the name Shakespeare has become a byword for literary genius.   This course will offer an introduction to a selection of Shakespeares tragedies and histories. As we read through the plays together, we will endeavor to understand whatand howthey meant in their original context, thereby developing a historically informed perspective on their influence over our own cultural landscape.",

We will read a wide array of short stories, a novella, and a novel, and study the techniques and elements of literary fiction as they are displayed in the works of established writers.  I will expect you to read the assigned works carefully, giving ample time and consideration to these readings, and to come to class prepared to discuss them.  You will also be expected to spend a good deal of time on your own writing, to improve upon that work throughout the term, and to provide thoughtful criticism on your classmates work.  By the end of the semester, you should have a solid understanding of the elements of successful literary fiction, be able to write meaningful critiques of such writing, and be able to write and revise a complete short story.  At times, the class will be fun, but it will also entail a good deal of effort and time on your part.  Overall, you should see this class as an opportunity to develop and share your creative work, and to learn skills and new ways of thinking about writing.  Section B: This class introduces you to a variety of literary fiction, and invites you to try your hand at your own writing, while focusing on aspects of the craft. We read and discuss fiction to learn about the craft and about the world of the various stories.",

Well look closely at traditional forms in an effort to understand the effects of more formal choices on the page, and well examine the craft choices of modern and contemporary poets to expand our understanding of poetic approaches. Our analysis of poetry will begin at the level of the syllable and progress to words, lines, stanzas, series, and collections. You will be required to read both published work and the work of your classmates with a critical eye, to write your own poems, both formal and not, to write several short analysis essays, to write a longer critical essay, and to demonstrate your knowledge on one in-class exam. The most important take-away from this class is the ability to talk knowledgeably and critically about poetry. What you learn here will pave the way for your future as both a writer and a reader.",

The main work of the course is a series of five situation-based writing assignments spread over three broad and often overlapping areas - business/professional writing, media writing, and technical writing.   Typical assignments include resumes, instructions, proposals, and adaptations of specialized information for non-expert audiences. At least one of the assignments will be a group project. As a final project, you?ll create a portfolio of polished writing samples that you can use in applying for internships and employment.   The range of assignments in the course is designed to give you experience with a variety of writing situations that professional writers frequently encounter. The assignments also reflect options for specialization that you may wish to pursue in future coursework and in your career as a professional writer. As you work through the assignments, you should learn both current conventions for the kinds of writing you?ll be doing and a broadly applicable procedure for analyzing novel situations and adapting conventional forms (and creating new ones) to meet the unique demands of each new situation and task.",

In addition, we will learn to support oral, visual, and collaborative modes of communication alongside more traditional written genres. Assessments include regular hands-on activities, reading responses, and participation in class discussions.

As we compare the environmental rhetoric of naturalists, scientists, policy makers, and activists, we will trace an American history that has managed to combine mystical celebration with militant critique, and scientific research with public debate. Equally important, this course will prepare you to act as a rhetorical consultant and writer, learning how writers communicate the three Rs of environmental rhetoric:  relationship with nature, the presence of risk, and the need for response.",

        "desc": "For almost a century the American film industry has dominated popular media worldwide.  Anywhere in the world, American stars, American films, and American modes of storytelling are never far away.  Why and how was that dominance achieved, and how have other cultures and industries challenged it?  Film and television account for billions of dollars of U.S. exports and provide one of the key sources of global soft power and cultural influence.  Understanding how that dominance works is therefore crucial to the question of Americas economic, political and cultural place in the world.  This course will examine ways in which other national cinemas have fought, or are currently fighting, against the hegemony of American popular film culture.  We will discuss a variety of national cinemas including those of France, Mexico, India and China (among others).  Students will be expected to watch at least two films a week outside of class, in addition to readings and written assignments.",

But the key to learning how to write in a journalistic style is to practice those skills so the core class work (and most of your grade) will be based on seven writing assignments due approximately every two weeks throughout the semester. Expect to do some writing each class period.  We will learn how to write a story lede (yes, thats how journalists spell it), how to structure a story and how to write different kinds of news stories, from crime news to features to editorials and commentary.  We also will learn how to research a news story, conduct an interview and sort through mountains of information to discern whats important so we can write about it in a clear, concise manner.",

Students in this six-unit mini will learn about best practices in tutoring, gain experience analyzing and responding to a wide range of academic and professional genres, and learn to adapt their tutoring style for different kinds of students. In addition, we will learn to support oral, visual, and collaborative modes of communication alongside more traditional written genres. Assessments include regular hands-on activities, reading responses, and participation in class discussions.  Please note that in terms of time commitment, a 6 unit mini is equivalent in weekly workload to a 12 unit full semester course. The mini is half the credits because it requires the same workload but only for half the semester.",

It is neither identitcal with literary studies, nor opposed to literary studies.  It is today one form that the study of literature or other cultural works may take.  This course offers a theoretical genealogy of cultural studies, showing how and why its theories and practices emerged and developed.  As a genealogy, the course does not assume that cultural studies has an essence or an origin.  The texts and topics will reflect the heterogeneity of its emergence and development.  The course does, however, embody what we see as several historical changes in cultural studies, from idealism to materialism, from mono to multiculturalism, and from high culture exclusiveness to democratic inclusivity.  The course is not designed to teach approaches, but to explore and interrogate the founding assumptions of the academic project that you are being trained to join.  Students should, by the end of the class, have a sense of where cultural studies came from and of the problems and possibilities raised by the theories it continues to invoke.",

Through readings, discussions, projects, and writing workshops, you will develop a rhetorically-grounded approach to analyzing communications problems and producing a range of effective and situation-specific professional documents. This user-centered approach views professional documents as means to accomplish specific, well-defined purposes: getting funding or support for a project (proposals), supporting managerial decision-making (reports), communicating effectively within organizations (email, correspondence), guiding action (instructional writing), getting a job or internship (resumes and application letters), or making choices among various medical treatments (science writing for general audiences). Because writers need a range of skills that go well beyond the actual inscribing of words on a page, you also gain practice in how to interview subject matter experts, work with clients, test documents on actual users, edit and revise your own work and that of other writers, and participate in and manage collaborative writing projects. The course features five or six major writing assignments, including a final portfolio of revised and polished work. Core course for MAPW students, elective option for other graduate students in English as room allows. Carnegie Mellon staff members who wish to expand their writing and communication practices and skills are welcome.",

        "desc": "Discourse is a focus of study in most of the humanities and social sciences, and discourse analysis is practiced in one way or another by anthropologists, communications scholars, linguists, literary critics, and sociologists, as well as rhetoricians.  Discourse analysts set out to answer a variety of questions about language, about writers and speakers, and about sociocultural processes that give rise to discourse and are constituted in discourse.  But all approach their tasks by paying close and systematic attention to particular constellations of texts and contexts.  We are all familiar with the informal discourse analysis involved in paraphrasing the meanings of written texts and conversations, a skill we learn in writing and literature classes and in daily life.  Here we ask and answer other questions about why people use language as they do, learning to move from a stretch of speech or writing or signing outward to the linguistic, cognitive, historical, social, psychological, and rhetorical reasons for its form and its function.  As we look at resources for text-building we read analyses by others and practice analyses of our own, using as data texts suggested by the class as well as the instructor. In the process, we discuss methodological issues involved in collecting texts and systematically describing their contexts (ethnographic participant-observation and other forms of naturalistic inquiry; transcription and entextualization; legal and ethical issues connected with collecting and using other peoples voices) as well as methodological issues that arise in the process of interpreting texts (analytical heuristics; reflexivity; standards of evidence).

Is the process of debate, deliberation, and decision (in which the best argument wins) really the ideal model?  Or can people use public spaces to develop new, more inclusive positions?  Could such a process occur in a boundary-crossing public when diverse groups enter intercultural deliberation around racial, social, or economic issues?  This course looks at diverse ways people use rhetoric to take literate social action within local publics. From the canonical debate around Habermas and the public sphere, we move to a feminist rereading of the Sophists,  to contemporary studies of deliberation in  workplaces, web forums, grassroots groups, new media, and community think tanks.    To support your own inquiry into the meaning making process of a local public, you will learn methods for activity analysis and for tracing social/cognitive negotiation within a public of your choice.",

        "desc": "This course introduces students to methods and materials that historians use to study the past. Its goals are: first, to familiarize students with ways that historians think about their research, how they carry it out, and how they debate findings with other historians; second, to train students in best practices for doing historical research in primary and secondary sources. We discuss how to ask questions about the past and develop a one-semester research topic, find appropriate primary and secondary sources, take notes from those sources, and write a paper that answers an original question using skills we have studied. In the Fall 2019 semester, we will use the topic of the history of African slavery in the New World (the US, Caribbean, and Latin America) and the Old World (Africa and the Middle East).  Although the institution of slavery dates back to antiquity across many of the worlds cultures, the trans-Atlantic slave trade and its legal abolition transformed many of the institutions through which people of sub-Saharan Africa were enslaved in the 18th and 19th centuries. Historians of the Atlantic World and the Islamic World have struggled to define slavery and the changing category of slave and to understand the experiences of the men, women, and children held in bondage by these institutions.  The first part of the class will consist of readings from primary sources such as eyewitness accounts, memoirs, poetry, and film to understand the meanings that participants gave to the experience of slavery. We also read secondary accounts of the way in which historians debate the meaning of slave and its transformation over time. Work includes reading and discussing course texts, completing short assignments, sharing writing-in-progress, oral reports to classmates, and a final research paper of 10-15-pages.",

European society was fundamentally transformed in this period of transition between the medieval and the modern eras, and the laws and legal systems that exist in the Western world today reflect those influences at the deepest levels.  This course will focus on how shifting definitions  of crime and punishment reflected prevailing societal attitudes and anxieties toward perceived acts of deviance and persons on the margins of society. Assigned readings will examine the evolution of early modern European criminal court systems, the investigation and punishment of crime, the criminalization of social deviance (witches, vagrants, religious minorities and other outcasts), and the legal enforcement of sexual morality and gender roles. We will address not only the historical significance of these developments, but their influence upon current debates concerning social deviancy, policing, torture, and criminal punishment.",

Students will move beyond textbooks to explore primary source documents, maps, photographs, biographies and historical testimony. For five weeks in the middle of the semester, students will immerse themselves in an extended role-playing exercise, The Struggle for Palestine, 1936, an elaborate simulation game linked to Barnard Colleges Reacting to the Past program. Students portraying British examiners, specific Arab and Zionist characters and journalists will recreate the activities of the 1936 Royal Commission which came to Palestine to investigate the causes of an Arab rebellion and Arab-Jewish strife. This historical reenactment experience constitutes an exciting pedagogical opportunity for delving deeper into the topic material than regular coursework allows. All the role-playing will take place during regular class time, but students should be aware that they will need to devote outside time for preparation and research. Outstanding attendance is also a requirement. Regular classroom activity resumes at the end of the five weeks. The goal of the course is for students to develop a nuanced understanding of the varying goals and priorities of all the actors in Mandate Palestine.

Understanding life under the Occupation and the collaborationist government in Vichy requires us to look back at major political, social and economic conditions of the 1930s that divided the French people. We use film and personal memoirs as well as recent historical studies to recreate and understand life during the war, and try to answer such questions as:  What accounts for the French military collapse of 1940?  Which groups of French men and women benefitted from collaboration with Germany? How did Frances collaboration in the Holocaust come about?  We also consider how the French people have tried to come to terms with their wartime experience since the 1940s. Classes include lecture and discussion as well as several in-class writing responses to the reading and lectures.",

The first half of the class is devoted to the period between the fall of the imperial system and the founding of the Peoples Republic of China (1911-1949).  If the victory of the Chinese Communist Party and development of the socialist state are to be considered in historical context, it is necessary to first understand the political, cultural, economic and intellectual currents that immediately preceded them. During the second half of the course, we will examine the Maoist period (1949-1976). We will investigate the Chinese Communist Party as both a state-building institution and an engine of social transformation, and consider the tensions these dual roles produced.  Finally, we will look at the Reform Period (1978-present), and reflect on a newly robust Chinas attempts to come to terms with its own recent past and what the consequences might be for both China and the world.",

History often serves as the battleground on which competing visions of the nation are fought - who should be included and excluded, where natural boundaries begin and end. This almost always requires a process of simplification in which inconvenient details are forgotten or repurposed in the service of national agendas. The Tibet Question is a telling example. In this class, we investigate the historical relationship between China and Tibet from the 13th century through the present, and note the ways advocates on both sides of the Tibet Question have constructed historical narratives (propaganda) in support of their political positions. We will also discuss the prospects for a political solution and consider the lessons the Tibet Question may hold for understanding other outstanding historical disputes.",

This course aims to equip you with a conceptual toolkit for thinking critically and holistically about the many dimensions of globalization.

How do particular regions reflect global trends in water resource development, and how might these diverge from global trends? How have social and environmental studies in the literature of development come to understand the problem of water?  One set of readings is assigned each week.

Focusing specifically on England and the United States, we will identify the factors (e.g., human agents, ideologies, etc.) that influenced major changes in the childbirth process and examine how these changes affected mothers and childbirth practitioners of the time. Additionally, we will consider what implications this historical study holds for interpreting contemporary debates surrounding womens health issues, including but not limited to childbirth.  Throughout this course, we make liberal use of primary sources to develop arguments about the large-scale changes that occurred between 1600 and the present.

Well explore the history of the relationship between science and religion and the different ways of knowing employed by each.

The first few weeks of the course will be devoted to developing a research topic and locating sources. We will then work on how to interpret and synthesize sources into a coherent and compelling thesis before you begin drafting your paper. Your research may be based on in-depth reading of a body of scholarly work, field notes from ethnographic observations, archival research, analysis of literary or visual media, or some combination of these sources. Incorporation of some non-English language sources is strongly encouraged where possible. Independent work, self-initiative, participation in discussion, and peer evaluations are required. There are several interim deadlines that will be strictly enforced in order to ensure successful completion of the course. Prerequisites: 79-275 and Theoretical and Topical Core must be complete or concurrently enrolled. Corequisite: 79-275.",

In each section we will read primary sources and discuss some of the main philosophic problems associated with that area. These will include: moral problems (Ethics), problems rising from the debates about free-will, personal identity or intelligence (Metaphysics), and inquiries about the scope and limits of human knowledge (Epistemology). We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homework and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments. These skills include: how to present a philosophic argument, what are the assumptions that justify it, what are its weaknesses and its strengths, whether such weaknesses can be resolved and, if they cannot be resolved, why.",

How should I (and others) act? What kinds of things out there must be treated ethically? Do we have moral duties to (at least some) non-human animals? Is morality subjective? Are there actually any objective moral truths? Morally speaking, what (if anything) is the difference between killing someone, and simply letting them die? In trying to answer these questions (and others), well engage in some wonderfully weird thought experiments, class discussions, smaller group discussions, debates, etc. Well study and critique several moral theories which try to explain and help guide our moral judgments, and well try to apply these theories to real-life moral controversies. Past classes covered topics including drug prohibition, abortion, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide.  \tThis is an introductory philosophy class, so youll be learning how to read, critique, do, and write philosophy generally, not just ethics. Considerable time and effort, both in lectures and in recitations, will be spent helping you learn to recognize and evaluate philosophical arguments, as well as empowering you to create, improve, and defend your own arguments in class assignments.",

Linguistics is the name given to the science of language, whose task it is to give such a description.   The discipline of linguistics has developed novel tools for describing and analyzing language over the last two hundred years and in this course we learn what these tools are and practice applying them.   Sub-areas of linguistics which we study include phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the study of sound systems), morphology (the study of parts of words), and syntax (the study of combinations of words). Beyond this, we look at changes in language over time, and we consider the puzzle of linguistic meaning. The methods of linguistics are useful in the study of particular languages and in the study of language generally, so this course is useful for students of foreign languages as well as those interested in going on to study language acquisition, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and computer modeling of language.",

Readings of historical and philosophical character complement the core content. This on-line course is supplemented, indeed given additional grounding, by weekly meetings in very small groups. There, we have collaborative reviews, substantive discussions and critical reflections.  The central question of the course is this:  How can we analyze the structure of rational discourse or, more specifically, the logical structure of argumentation?  An answer to this question requires: (i) uncovering the logical form of statements; (ii) defining the correctness of logical steps; (iii) formulating inference rules for the logical forms; (iv) designing strategies for argumentation with the inference rules. The course takes these steps for both sentential and quantificational logic.",

Does explanation contribute to a theorys confirmation by the evidence? Does science aim to find the truth? Is probability in the world or only in our minds?

        "desc": "Science is an ever-changing enterprise. Most scientific advances, though significant, occur within a stable framework of accepted theories and data. A few episodes of change in the history of science involve discarding and replacing fundamental theories of the world. These are often accompanied by significant changes in the vocabulary in which those theories are expressed, the tools used by scientists, the phenomena on which scientists focus, and the kinds of explanations they consider acceptable. A very small number of these episodes change the way humanity views its ability to know the natural world and its place in universe. The latter two kinds of change in science have often been called scientific revolutions. We will focus on three such radical transformations: The Copernican Revolution (or the Scientific Revolution) of the 16th and 17th centuries, the Darwinian revolution of the 19th century, and the quantum revolution of the late 19th and 20th centuries. This course has two intertwined components: history of science and philosophy of science. In the historical component, we will examine in some detail the three major scientific revolutions. The philosophical components will help us understanding the reasoning involved in scientific theory change. This course does not required detailed knowledge of any of the sciences used in examples of revolutionary change.",

Over the centuries, however, many have succumbed to what J. R. R. Tolkien called the secret vice of language creation.  The purposes of these invented languages have been diverse. Some, like Tolkiens Elvish languages, Okrands Klingon, and Petersons Dothaki and Trigedasleng have been designed for artistic or entertainment purposes: they have set out to be natural languages within fictional worlds. Others, like Zamenhofs Esperanto, Browns Loglan, and Elgins Ladan have tried to address perceived inadequacies of the natural languages that their creators saw in the world around them. The of study language invention is thus both the study of a distinctive art form, and an exploration of the history of how people have thought about language in different ages and societies.  In this course, we will explore the linguistic considerations involved in language invention, and the linguistic lessons of the history of invented languages, with a particular emphasis on applying these insights to our own language invention projects. Over the course of the semester, students will be expected to develop invent their own languages, and to complete various shorter assignments to supplement relevant ideas and skills. This course does not assume any background in linguistics, and is intended to accommodate both newcomers and advanced students.",

This is an advanced course in social and political philosophy, aimed at providing students with a more in-depth familiarity with classic and contemporary questions both theoretical and applied.  The course is topical, and course topics will vary from year to year.  Typically 4-5 topics are covered in a term. Previous years topics have included the nature and value of freedom, social contract theory, racial and epistemic injustice and the nature of white ignorance, the intersecting concepts of justice and equality, structural injustice, responsibility for injustice, and immigration.    Students are expected to come away from the course with a strong understanding of some of the major debates in social and political theory as well as the tools to analyze ongoing debates within contemporary US and global politics regarding the appropriate way to organize our social and political reality.  This course is primarily conducted as a seminar and is discussion- rather than lecture-based.",

Those who live in extreme poverty frequently lack effective access to proper nutrition, adequate shelter, safe drinking water, and sanitation.  As a result, they also bear the greatest burdens of famine and epidemic disease and frequently face social and political conditions of unrest and systematic oppression.  This course aims to introduce students to the problem of global public health and its intersection with claims of human rights.  We will focus on theoretical accounts of human rights and questions arising from them: What constitutes a human right, and on what basis or bases might the existence of human rights be defended?  If human rights exist, whose responsibility is it to see that they are defended/provided/not violated, and why? What is the relationship between health deficits and human rights deficits, and what would a human right to health look like?  Are global institutions such as the protection of strong intellectual property rights consistent with respect for a human right to health?",

The study of meaning in language, semantics, is a recently developed subfield of linguistics, since it presupposes advances in phonology, morphology, and syntactic structure. In addition, semantics faces the conceptual challenge of saying what meaning is. This course will reflect the history of semantics within linguistic theory and examine solutions to the problem of the definition of meaning. The course begins with the meanings of words and examines how these meanings combine to give the meanings of sentences, based on the notion of truth conditions for indicative sentences. That notion of meaning is then extended to sentences in other moods, and to sentences that do not simply describe how the world is, including sentences which are modal, conditional, or simply fictional.  Semantics is a subject that can be developed in a highly formal way, but here it will be presented to make it accessible to students with varied backgrounds and interests. The components of the resulting theory will apply to any human language, and be an important component in the toolkit of any student of language.",

A leading idea is functorial semantics, according to which a model of a logical theory is a set-valued functor on a category determined by the theory. This gives rise to a syntax-invariant notion of a theory and introduces many algebraic methods into logic, leading naturally to the universal and other general models that distinguish functorial from classical semantics. Such categorical models occur, for example, in denotational semantics. e.g. treating the lambda-calculus via the theory of cartesian closed categories. Higher-order logic is treated categorically by the theory of topoi. We will also consider the categorical semantics of type theory via locally cartesian closed categories.  A prerequisite for this course if familiarity with basic category theory (as treated in the course 80-413/713), but depending on demand the course can start with a quick refresher of the central concepts.",

Students will work towards improving their writing, reading, listening and speaking abilities in Spanish, such that they become comfortable working with a variety of topics from Spanish-speaking cultural areas. Students will develop basic interactional and routine public communication patterns. This course is designed for students with no previous knowledge of Spanish and who need a more flexible approach to language learning than that offered in a standard classroom course. All materials are Web-based, with extensive use of Internet technologies for research, writing, and communication. During regular semesters, this course is offered in a hybrid mode requiring one 80-minute class per week in addition to weekly 20-minute individual meetings with the instructor or a peer speaking assistant. There is a materials fee for taking this course which is paid by credit card on first log-in to the course website.  Students who have taken Spanish before are required to take the placement exam.",

Language is presented in communicative contexts illustrating cultural aspects of daily Russian life. The elementary level is also designed to help students learn to reflect and draw upon strategies used by good language learners in their second language study. Daily homework and participation in class are mandatory (four in-class hours per week), as is weekly consultation and conversation practice with a course assistant. A student with prior experience in Russian must take the placement exam. **If you would like to take this course, but the current time slot does not work with your schedule please contact the instructor as soon as possible and we may be able to accommodate you**",

Analyses of each storytelling not only reveal the cultural dynamics behind Japanese modernity, but also invite students to find new insights into Japanese culture and their ways of perceiving our globalized world. What kind of cultural exchanges took place between modern Japan and the West? How are Japans traditional values transformed in the face of modern technicalization and industrialization, compared to the modernization of other countries? And, in turn, what kind of impact has modern Japanese culture had on todays world? Tackling these questions among others, the course also extends to such issues as the legacy of traditional Japanese culture, the modern Emperor system, World War II experiences, emerging voices of minorities, and popular culture (e.g., anime and subculture).

Local, national, and international governmental organizations make choices about the language or languages they recognize and use for political and economic affairs. The United Nations even recognizes language as integral to maintaining the cultural heritage of communities and peoples around the world, and the freedom to choose ones language of expression as a universal human right.   In this course, we will explore a variety of questions, advantages, and challenges related to language diversity and cultural identity across the globe. Our main focus will be on contexts of multilingualism that is, contexts in which two or more languages may be used. Adopting a comparative case study approach, we will explore the following themes: (i) The historical underpinnings of language diversity and its consequences for cultural identity today (e.g., migration, colonization, conquest); (ii) How language diversity and cultural identity shapes, and is shaped by, local, regional, national, and international politics; (iii) The relationship between language diversity and language use and visibility in public spaces (i.e., the linguistic landscape); (iv) Relations between linguistic communities (e.g., majority and minority language users) and the sense of belonging to a culture.   The course is taught in English. Students who wish to take the course as a Modern Languages major or minor elective will need to complete their final project on a topic relevant to the language they study.",

By studying French history, institutions, regions, literature, and current events, students understand how a cultural identity is developed throughout a countrys history. Comparisons between current events and Frances cultural and social development from the Renaissance forward explain in part the French mentality and how and why France and the French react to the world as they do.

The culture commonly associated with the French language is the primarily Christian and Cartesian European tradition. Through this course, students will learn about the socio-political and cultural realities of the Francophone sphere. The course will also explore the multiple synthetic cultural realities which have arisen through the colonial and post-colonial processes of contact between European and non-European cultures, and which are now expressed through the medium of the French language. Students will expand their interpersonal and presentational communication skills in both written and spoken French, improve reading and listening skills through various media so as to analyze content objectively, use appropriate vocabulary and grammar to express critical judgments, synthesize ideas from different source materials, and continue perfecting cultural analysis skills. Assignments will include using accepted academic conventions for research documentation and exposition. Social debates and current events will add a valuable perspective to our study.

This course will explore Latin American culture and language, focusing on issues of cultural identity. Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of Who we are? becomes a central debate (Larrain 1996).  These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?; How does Latin America think of itself?; What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

Our exploration of U.S. Latino history and cultures will compare and contrast the experiences of people from the above-described categories and analyze the dynamic tension amongst them, with other minority groups, and with the mainstream US society. We will examine a wide variety of materials, including texts, film, art, music etc. in order to gain a better understanding of Latino populations in the United States.

Students will improve their language use (reading, speaking, writing, and listening).      FALL 2019: Outsiders Within - Exile Beyond Borders  This course will examine human movement across national boundaries in the Spanish-speaking world.  While immigration is an age-old phenomenon, through the end of 20th century and the opening decades of the 21st, we have witnessed a rise in people fleeing their home countries, seeking refuge from political strife, from economic displacement due to changes in the global economy, as well as from violence - be it State-sponsored or that perpetrated by other transnational actors (gangs, cartels etc.).  In the US, Europe, and Latin America, increased immigration and seeking of asylum have often been met with highly nationalistic, anti-immigrant discourses, coupled with calls for more restrictive immigration policies.  In this course, we will examine some of the dynamics that lead to mass immigration in search of asylum, as well as political and cultural responses.  We will analyze how the media, as well as musicians, artists and human rights activists respond to what has been termed a humanitarian crisis.  While we will broadly consider some of the trends in the Spanish-speaking world, we will also do some very specific case studies, such as Central American asylum-seekers in the US, and Venezuelan and Nicaraguan refugees seeking sanctuary in countries like Panama and Costa Rica.

FALL 2018: Youth Culture  Japanese society is currently confronted with a massive array of social and cultural anomalies among its youth.  In the culture, which values and emphasizes conformity, the phenomenon is utterly unprecedented.  Accordingly, in this course, we will first explore the defining features of these anomalies  by examining how Japanese youth are portrayed in modern day fictions and films.  We will then scrutinize the extent to which these portrayals actually reflect real lives of young Japanese by analyzing newspaper articles and essays commenting on the social issues surrounding them.  Finally, we will take a close look at the dramatic social changes, over the past three decades, to trace their long-term impacts  as a significant factor contributing to the emergence of the new culture, particularly with respect to the changing youth behaviors.  F17:The Evolution of Japans Urban Culture This course analyzes various aspects of Japans urban culture, the evolution of which has centered around Tokyo, focusing on such topics as the Taisho modernism during 1912-1926, the post-WWII Americanization of Japanese culture and society, the culture surrounding the Bubble Economy during 1980-1995, and the popular culture that has continued to thrive on a global scale, through fictions, non-fictions, films, and multimedia.

It familiarizes the student with the basic structures and processes of American government, but moves beyond the purely descriptive into the realm of the analytical.  The main theoretical tools are spatial models of political decision-making, and models of collective action problems.  The position taken in this course is that understanding American philosophical ideas about authority, power, and freedom is as central to demystifying the U.S. form of democracy as is understanding how decision-making institutions function.  Thus, on one side, this course looks at how American political thought is infused into political institutions and society.  On the other side, it investigates institutional arrangements using rationalistic theories.  In addition, scientific writings at the intersection of psychology and economics are used to probe the possibility of gaining explanatory leverage on U.S. politics from the perspective of behavioral decision-making theories.",

Although you will learn about some current international issues and about the evolution of international relations, and see how various theories would explain important past international events, the focus of this course is analytic rather than substantive. In other words, it will focus on general arguments and their underlying logic rather than on specific events and details or, for that matter, definitive answers as to which side is right. As such, this course will help you to better understand the world we live in and provide you with tools for analyzing various international events. It will also acquaint you with many of the frameworks frequently used by statesmen, either implicitly or explicitly, in order to understand the world and to make policy on various issue areas. The course will begin by analyzing approaches from the three main levels of analysis: the individual, domestic (liberal and non-liberal theories) and systemic (neorealism, etc.). It will move on to discuss approaches which focus on, for example, the effects of strategic interactions between states, of international institutions and of norms and of the overall social environment that states live in.  The course will then conclude by discussing the future of international relations.",

Part III will cover separation of powers, federalism and judicial review of agency action. Reading assignments will include short excerpts from relevant books/periodicals. Students will also be asked to read court opinions. Although these opinions may be filled with legal jargon, at their essence, most concern the tension between individual rights and government efficiency and control.

Students intern three days per week, for approximately 24-25 hours, in offices from Capitol Hill to the White House and including opportunities in cabinet agencies, nonprofit institutions, museums, advocacy groups, policy think tanks, cultural institutions, and news organizations.  Through the internship, students gain professional experience and make long-lasting professional and personal contacts. In addition, students meet once a week with the CMU internship faculty for a 2-hour seminar to report and reflect on their internship experiences, and address pressing current issues from the perspective of their internship organization.   In addition, the weekly seminar typically includes 1-2 CMU alumni from the Washington, DC, area. Their personal and professional experiences become part of the seminar conversation, and they make themselves available to students as ongoing sources of information and advice.

The class then surveys contemporary diplomatic challenges, including challenges posed by human trafficking, global climate change, nuclear proliferation, democracy promotion, and major powers such as Russia and China. Both in the classroom and in writing, students are encouraged to think, act, and write like diplomats and to appreciate diplomacy as a vocation.

The principle concepts examined in this course reflect, have shaped, and continue to shape state and non-state actor behaviors and their calculations of how to prepare for and prosecute warfare. These include, among others, conventional and nuclear deterrence, offense-defense dynamics, first strike capabilities, and irregular warfare. The course will focus on theory but will leverage history, military doctrine, and cases to highlight the challenges of integrating cyber war into defense planning and practice. Students will be challenged to consider how the 2009 introduction of cyberspace as a warfighting domain- in addition to land, maritime, air, and space- affects the ways that scholars and practitioners- operating with force structures and strategic, operational, and tactical concepts that are decades, if not centuries old- conceive of and practice warfare in the 21st Century.  The principle objective of this course is to introduce students to cyber war within the context of traditional, and emerging, concepts of armed and unarmed warfare. This course will focus on two core areas: 1) a discussion of traditional concepts of warfare in the physical domains; and, 2) a discussion of cyber war and its intersection with these traditional concepts.",

        "desc": "The Policy Forum course takes a critical look at decision making in domestic politics and US foreign policy.  It does so through weekly roundtable discussions with a diverse set of thought leaders.  Based on intellectually significant essays that students are expected to read in advance of each class, these discussions give students an opportunity to ask probing questions about the three branches of the US government, media, embassies, advocacy groups, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations.  This course seeks to help students understand the responsibilities and activities that leaders and decision makers carry out on behalf of their organizations.  Students are instructed in how to confidently and respectfully ask critical questions of those shaping policy.  The term roundtabling is used to describe submitting an issue for critical discussion among relevant stakeholders.  Knowing how to direct a roundtable is a significant element in the professional development of anyone interested in taking part in the policy arena, and this course helps students hone this important skill.  In requiring students to read  important essays related to each class session and then step back from discussions with leaders to write analytical essays, this course teaches students how to develop strong arguments based on solid logic and credible evidence, an essential component in making democracy work.",

In the contemporary conflict environment, hybrid actors and proxy groups wage war in an asymmetric and irregular manner, relying on ambiguity, strategic surprise and deception to accomplish their objectives. This course will examine new trends in warfare, from the onset of cyber war to the development of violent non-state actors with conventional military capabilities. Moreover, this course will explore the concept of the gray zone, an area of neither declared nor undeclared hostilities where U.S. adversaries like Russia, China, Iran and others are gradually allocating resources. Case studies examined in this course will include Russian hybrid warfare in Crimea and Ukraine, Chinese cyberwarfare and information operations, Iranian sponsorship of proxy militias in Syria and Lebanon and a range of other emerging trends in areas such as technology, demographics, urbanization and social media, all of which are combining to radically alter the way wars are fought today.",

        "desc": "This course examines the foundations of the comparative analysis of political institutions, analyzes how institutions vary across countries, and explores some of the main consequences of such variation. The first section introduces the analysis of institutions, discusses the predominant theories that address institutional variation and change, and presents the development of modern state institutions. The second segment discusses how relevant political institutions differ worldwide, including regime types (democracies versus nondemocracies), forms of democratic regime (presidential and parliamentary systems), constitutions, electoral rules, legislatures, political parties, informal institutions, veto players, federalisms, and judicial institutions. The third section centers on the consequences of political institutions, with an emphasis on the analysis of empirical evidence from developing and developed countries. A primary concern throughout the course is how the potential endogeneity among institutions affects our capacity to achieve reliable inferences. Methodologically, this course mainly builds on the rational choice school, but also integrates other perspectives.",

This course applies leading theories, ideas, historical analyses and policy-oriented research in the examination of emerging challenges in national security.  In particular, the course addresses the following: why so many people in the United States and elsewhere thought the end of the Cold War would usher in an era of international peace; the emergence and evolution of global terrorism; military revolutions, transformations, and offsets; cyber threats in peace and war; the reemergence of state threats; emerging technologies and war; and the enduring need for hard power.  Understanding emerging trends in the global security environment requires assessing contemporary ideas from thought leaders in the field.  Thus, this course focuses on arguments that have shaped the thinking of policy makers at key turning points in the post-Cold War environment and some of the most influential arguments shaping the national security policy debate today.",

The course provides an overview of the major areas of scientific psychology, exploring the models of our mind, brain, and behavior that explain wide areas of human (and non-human) functioning.  Topics range from neuroscience and the biological basis of behavior, to memory and thought, to social interaction and psychological development over the lifespan, to abnormal psychology, psychopathology, and treatment.  Tuesday and Thursday lectures will provide a broad survey of topics and findings in psychology and how to use scientific reasoning to answer questions about the mind.  Recitation sections will focus on learning the methods, issues, and applications germane to empirical psychology. At the end of this course, students will not only be more knowledgeable about psychology, but be able to apply their knowledge about psychology to be better thinkers, learners, and consumers of information in general.",

Students in the course will be exposed to several broad theoretical perspectives, each of which attempts to capture and understand the origins and consequences of individual distinctiveness from a slightly different vantage point. Included among these approaches are the dispositional or trait, psychoanalytic, learning, humanistic, and cognitive self regulation perspectives. This is a survey course and is intended to provide students with a broad background of theory and research in the area. Class meetings consist primarily of lecture, but there is some discussion too. Students will be given the opportunity to assess their own personalities during the course. A consistent theme throughout the course is the relationships between aspects of ones personality and physical health.  https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/pdf/syllabi-2018-spring/85-25120Scheier20revised.docx",

        "desc": "Perception, broadly defined, is the construction of a representation of the external world for purposes of thinking and acting.  Although we often think of perception as the processing of inputs to the sense organs, the world conveyed by the senses is ambiguous, and cognitive and sensory systems interact to interpret it.  In this course, we will examine the sensory-level mechanisms involved in perception by various sensory modalities, including vision, audition, and touch.  We will learn how sensory coding interacts with top-down processing based on context and prior knowledge and how perception changes with learning and development. We will look at methods of psychophysics, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology.  The goals include not only imparting basic knowledge about perception but also providing new insights into everyday experiences.",

The readings will deal primarily with autism in people whose IQs are in the normal range (high functioning autism). Seminar members will be expected to regularly enter to class discussions and make presentations based on the readings.     The seminar will examine various domains of thinking and various biological underpinnings of brain function, to converge on the most recent scientific consensus on the biological and psychological characterization of autism.

Although a variety of relationship phenomena will be discussed, a heavy emphasis will be placed on research that addresses fundamental processes in close relationships.  The coverage of material will include a review of historical roots and classic approaches to the scientific study of relationships, as well as exciting new research and theory on particular subtopics.  The majority of class time is spent discussing and evaluating recent research. Special emphasis also is given to learning and critically evaluating the methodological tools that are used to study close relationships.  The goal is for students to leave this course with a broad overview of the field and an in-depth understanding of particular subtopics.      This is an advanced seminar in which students will be expected to read original research articles and chapters on assigned topics and come to class prepared to discuss the material.  Readings will consist of theoretical and empirical articles from psychology journals and related sources.  Additional course requirements will involve short, weekly writing assignments, student presentations of research articles, and a written research proposal.  Over the course of the semester, students will design and carry out a small-scale, original investigation on a relationships topic of interest.",

These bubbles -- information bubbles, market bubbles, social bubbles -- drive us to ask some of the most basic questions in the social sciences: Why do we believe the things we do? Where do our ideas come from, and how can we measure the consequences of their conjecture, spread, and evolution? How can we design systems to make us better thinkers? In this introduction to the big data study of human behavior, well learn some key concepts and simple computational tools for studying how people gain and share information, with a focus on what they say and write. And well apply these tools to social behaviors from the writing of Harry Potter fan fiction to online trolling, to science, markets, and liberal democracy itself. The class will include conceptual, computational, and data-driven investigations; students in social science, humanities, engineering and the sciences are equally welcome. At the end of this course, students will be able to build models for how people think and talk to each other, to see how thinking and talking work in both the past and present, and to imagine, and even design, systems that might help us think, and talk, together more effectively in the future.

Indeed, the protection of these essential rights in many ways drove and defined their successful rebellion from Britain.  This impulse resulted in ten amendments to the Constitution, which we have come to know as the Bill of Rights.   The very first (and arguably considered at the time as the most essential) of these was the First Amendment, which we sometimes call the free speech amendment to the Constitution.  This amendment guarantees every U.S. citizen five freedoms: freedom of religion, speech, press, peaceable assembly, and the freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances.  This course examines the historical and philosophical roots of this key constitutional amendment, how it has been fleshed out and defined over time through case law, and the bases of some more recent critics of this amendments and current interpretations.",

In this course, we will investigate the success of this approach in explaining ostensible anomalies in the wild such as under-savings for retirement, over-consumption of unhealthy food, extreme aversion to losses among investors, workers, and home-owners, the over-confidence of corporate CEOs and NFL general managers, and the influence of emotions on domestic violence, stock market activity, and risk-taking.   We will first document and review the underlying theory for three conceptual departures from the standard model -non-standard preferences (e.g., present-bias, reference dependence), non-standard beliefs (e.g., overconfidence, gamblers fallacy), and non-standard decision-making (e.g., heuristics, emotions, framing effects)-and then quickly move to assess the evidence for these claims in field settings.   We will additionally explore how markets respond to behavioral biases, and discuss recent research in behavioral policy with an emphasis on policies aimed at increasing savings, improving food choice, and heightening program take-up and compliance.  The course will be paper-centric and we will review a variety of popular empirical methods from field experiments to quasi-experimental approaches (e.g., estimation through regression-based panel analyses, difference-in-differences, and instrumental variables).  Student evaluation will be based on performance on problem sets, an exam, as well as a short class presentation of an empirical paper of choice.",

Decision-makers use negotiation to reach agreements with co-workers, bosses, clients, subordinates, firms, family and friends. Hence, the ability to negotiate effectively is a critical skill. In this course, students will develop a systematic and insightful approach to negotiation. Students will learn to analyze the features of the negotiation environment, develop an understanding of effective negotiation strategies and tactics, and identify the barriers and the psychological factors that may prevent decision-makers from reaching wise agreements. Considerable emphasis will be placed on negotiation exercises and role-playing. In-class discussions and lectures will supplement the exercises. This course will focus on negotiations in a wide variety of context: public policy negotiations, business negotiations, salary negotiations, and inter-personal negotiations.",

This new course will provide an overview of approaches to this difficult process of social policy making with a focus on the role that social forces and the state play in the generation of policy responses to poverty and inequality.  The course will discuss the role that new approaches to social policy play in the alleviation of poverty and inequality, including the impact of Conditional Cash Transfers such as Bolsa de Familia. Ongoing debates on the advantages and disadvantages of public versus private programs in the areas of social security and health will also be analyzed. The first section of the course will focus on approaches to poverty and inequality in the US and Western Europe and the second one on Africa and Latin America.",

        "desc": "Professional writing, or writing for business-focused, industry-specific contexts, differs from academic writing in objective, audience, structure, style, and format. It focuses more on problem solving than on exposition of ideas and is generally targeted to diverse audiences with varying levels of expertise.  Therefore, effective writing in the workplace often requires adapting writing skills and habits to meet readers needs.  Additionally, when hiring recent graduates for a mid-level position, employers identify writing skills as one of the top five factors signaling leadership potential.                                                                       Whether youre looking to maximize the impact of your communications at work, seeking project funding, or looking to increase your visibility on-line, this seven-week mini course will prepare you to assume a leadership role in your industry through effective written communication. This course will not only help you refine the essentials of workplace writing, but will also provide strategies, guidelines, and best practices for writing the kinds of industry-specific documents that policy, information security/systems, and creative industry professionals need.   This course is designed for experienced writers who want to take their skills to the next level.  This course assumes basic proficiency in English grammar.",

However, this same accounting information can be accessed, disaggregated and analyzed to get the information necessary for strategic planning.    Purpose: The purpose of this class is to familiarize students with the language and techniques of managerial accounting and to develop and sharpen analytic abilities.  This course focuses as much as possible on the practical application of managerial analysis. Students will learn the key analytical skills for both planning and evaluating past performance.    This course relies heavily on performing calculations (number crunching) and interpreting the results. Material is presented in a combination of lecture and modeling cases. It is assumed that participants have a general knowledge of accounting as well as a basic knowledge of Excel.   Objectives of the course: - Master common managerial accounting techniques like Cost Volume Profit Analysis, Product and service costing and the impact on pricing, overhead allocation, Activity Based Costing, budgeting and performance analysis and long term Investment decision making..   - Make and communicate recommendations that are supported by relevant data.   - Develop skills to build flexible financial models and to use sensitivity analysis to evaluate opportunities and deal with problems skillfully.      Format: The sessions each week are generally divided into two parts, lecture and a lab in which students implement managerial accounting techniques by developing models in Excel.  Homework assignments will ask students to evaluate a business situation, make, and support their decision based on their analysis.",

The primary methods taught are strategies for thinking critically and creatively about public policy problems and solutions and for helping public and private leaders to make good decisions about public policies.  The course will not teach advanced methodologies in statistics, econometrics, operations research, or financial analysis, but it will focus on ways to quickly and effectively analyze available information (both quantitative and qualitative) with limited resources and time. During the course, students will learn by doing analyses themselves and by discussing how to analyze problems in class.  Students will examine several different complex policy problems in depth, and they will develop alternative approaches for addressing them, evaluate the impacts of those alternatives, and grapple with the complex and often conflicting considerations involved in making recommendations for action.  The specific policy problems have been selected to expose students to a range of substantive areas (e.g., criminal justice, economic development, education, energy, environmental protection, health, and human services) and to a range of generic types of public policies (e.g., regulations, entitlement programs, incentives, etc.).",

In this class, you will explore the real estate development process, the context by which real estate is developed, valuation and financing methodologies, and the role of the public in supporting private real estate development through a combination of lecture, discussion, and guest speakers.    You will have fun building your real estate toolkit.   You will meet and learn from practicing real estate development professionals (including me) and explore real world real estate developments.  From main streets to downtown office towers, you will gain a new appreciation and insight into how the places you live, work, and play came to be. Your learning will be assessed through individual take-home assignments, a group case study, class participation, and an in-class presentation. While there are no specific prerequisites for this course, you should have basic Excel modeling skills and basic understanding of finance.",

        "desc": "For most of the past 40 years, no region of the world has been more economically dynamic than Asia.  This economic growth transformed the patterns of world trade, lifted millions out of absolute poverty, and so captivated the attention of Western economists and business leaders that it was commonplace by the early 1990s to refer to the economic achievements of these countries as the East Asian miracle.  The nature of this apparent miracle changed dramatically over the course of the 1990s as the most advanced economy in the region, Japan, suffered a sharp growth slowdown, and a number of the other miracle economies were engulfed in a regional economic crisis in the latter half of the decade.  These events highlighted weaknesses in the East Asian growth model that had been hidden during the boom years.  Despite these economic problems, accelerating growth in the worlds most populous countries, China and India, helped sustain regional progress and kept global attention focused on economic growth in Asia through the 2000s and 2010s, even though the growth and the international attention were largely concentrated in a different set of countries.  However, new worries about Chinese economic growth have emerged in recent years.  Is Chinas growth miracle slowing down?  How does the economic history of Asias more advanced economies inform our view of the future economic prospects for India and China?  In what ways are China and India pursuing a different path to economic development than that taken by their predecessors?  The United States has long played an important role in Asia as an investor, customer, and key ally of important nations in the region.  How will the policies of the Trump Administration shape these important relationships and the future evolution of the region?  We will seek to address all of these questions.",

As a result, the course will explore the deep connections between conflict and development because conflict happens largely in developing countries and because conflict interferes with the development process and with the capacity of countries to have a sustainable development model.  This course will focus on the struggle that selected Latin American and African countries have had in achieving a satisfactory level of development and the negative impact of conflict on development. Conversely, we will examine why conflicts and the human rights abuses resulting from those conflicts happen mostly in countries at a low level of development.   In brief, the course will examine: a) Development approaches pursued in Africa and Latin America,  b) Civil wars that have taken place in those continents and the human rights abuses that took place during those conflicts.  c) The role of international organizations, peacekeepers, and foreign aid have played in both the development process, during and after major conflicts.  d) Lastly, well look at the human rights abuses suffered by people in selected countries and the policies pursued to confront the abusers known as Transitional Justice Policies",

The emphasis of the classes on descriptive statistics is the calculation and interpretation of summary statistical measures for describing raw data. The sessions on statistical inference are designed to provide you with the background for executing and interpreting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The final component of the course focuses on regression analysis, a widely used statistical methodology.

Our goal will be to understand, from a practical perspective, how economics, , technology, politics, public opinion, national security, and environmental / climate considerations all influence the development and implementation of policy.  Questions that we will address include:  How has U.S. energy policy changed over the years and what lessons have we learned from past initiatives? How much influence does government really have? How have new technologies changed the energy landscape?  What priority do national leaders give to energy policy?  And how does energy policy impact our relationships with other countries?   The class will begin with an overview of the energy sector and the related government structure. After covering some historical context, we will discuss Presidential initiatives and legislative activity, with a particular focus on more recent activities. We will then consider some case studies, such as the Keystone Pipeline, EPAs Clean Power Plan, and the development of the Marcellus Shale, that demonstrate conflicting viewpoints about appropriate energy policy. The class will also explore international energy issues like exports of liquefied natural gas and crude oil exports, as well as the Paris Climate Agreement.    This course is a seminar class; I will provide a framework and then guide a discussion among the students. Depending on the particular class session, we will have individual or group presentations. Your preparation and participation is essential.  Each session will begin with a short review and discussion of current events in the energy sector. We will also hear from guest speakers, including a number of current and former senior government officials.",

        "desc": "In this course you will learn how to gather and synthesize evidence to address this question. Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the programs design and implementation, and ultimately the programs impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the programs merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making.  Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.  This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation. Students will be taught how to conduct basic program evaluations as well as how to critique and monitor more comprehensive program evaluations. Successful completion of this course will prepare students to be contributing members of teams that design and carry out program evaluations or that commission program evaluations and make decisions based upon their results.",

This introduction provides a framework to aid students in navigating from public policy through to healthcare delivery.  Public policy is the study of the written and unwritten principles on which law is based.  Laws and regulations translate policy into action. Public policy and laws form the basis of health policy. Health policy is supported by:      - Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness)     - Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality)     - Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality, and cost. At this time in our history, Healthcare Reform best embodies the intent of this aspect of health policy.  Through the use of group assignments, students will create a model which links the external environment into healthcare delivery profitability. Modeling is a form of combining individual technical components with the greater knowledge and conceptualization of the entire process. Its promise is to promote better decision making by envisioning how micro decisions interconnect to mission, goals, and outcomes.",

The answers to these questions, and others like them, require a detailed knowledge of the law and politics that lie behind the budget process, and the difficult policy choices that make up that process each year.  This course proceeds simultaneously along two tracks.  Track I will cover the law and procedures you need to understand how the federal budget is formulated and acted upon.  This sounds dull, but it isnt  For good reason, people call Congress the worlds greatest soap opera; and the budget process, while complex, is full of political warfare, the clashing of egos, and the constant pressure of voter demands.  Those who know the law and procedures can gain an advantage over others in the struggle for dollars and the way they get spent. While in this phase of the course, you will be assigned mini-briefs: short oral presentations on certain technical aspects of the budget.  Track II will introduce you to some of the important budget issues that have made life so difficult for Republicans and Democrats alike: working out an effective budget process, balancing the budget, funding budget priorities with limited resources, and deciding how much (and how) to tax workers and investors.  When we are working on Track II, you will develop two-pagers, the kinds of memoranda and statements written by congressional staff and political advisers.",

The perspective of four different actors will be highlighted throughout the course: US Government; non?governmental organization; developing country; and multilateral institution. Students will learn analytic frameworks to hone their skill in two distinct components of policymaking: crafting sound policies and mastering the policy process. The course readings and guest lectures will provide insight and a realistic grounding in how to operate most effectively in the fluid and fastpaced global policy environment, and provide lessons on how to navigate and prevail in the highly contentious and charged policy debates surrounding international development. This course will not delve deeply into the equally challenging area of policy implementation, though suggested readings are provided. The course presumes no previous knowledge or experience in international development and does not attempt to provide a comprehensive review of the theoretical literature in the international development field.",

        "desc": "Empirical research is most valuable when it uses data to answer specific causal questions, as if in a randomized clinical trial. In the absence of a real experiment, we look for well-controlled comparisons and/or natural quasi-experiments. Some research designs are more convincing than others, but the econometric methods behind them are almost always fairly simple. This course provides an introduction to the most important items in an applied econometricians toolkit: (i) analysis of randomized controlled trials; (ii) regression models designed to control for variables that may mask the causal effects of interest; (iii) difference-in-differences-type strategies that use repeated observations to control for unobserved omitted factors; and (iv) instrumental variables and regression discontinuity methods for the analysis of real and natural experiments. In this course, emphasis will be given to conceptual issues and statistical techniques that turn up in the applied research we read and do. Many empirical examples will illustrate these ideas and techniques.  Within the Heinz College, 90-906 is appropriate for first-year PhD students plus first and second year Masters students who desire and are prepared for a rigorous course in econometrics as a base for more advanced research methodology. Outside the Heinz school, 90-906 may be of interest to graduate students in Engineering and Public Policy, Social and Decision Science, Software Engineering, Psychology, GSIA, Philosophy, Applied History, or Architecture who need background in econometrics targeted toward social and policy research.",

The primary objective of the course is to familiarize students with the microeconomic paradigm and develop an appreciation of the usefulness (and limitations) of microeconomic analysis. A further goal of the course is to develop and exercise students ability to use economic analysis in examining applied issues and more generally to help students acquire formal modeling skills -- the ability to reduce real-world problems to useful and mathematically tractable representations.    This course is designed for the following students: (i) Ph.D. students who want to increase their exposure to microeconomics but do not expect to use formal microeconomics in their research (i.e. students for whom this course is likely to be their last course in microeconomics); (ii) Ph.D. students who plan to study microeconomics beyond the introductory level of this course but do not have the background for the microeconomic sequence offered at GSIA; and (iii) M.S. students who have an especially strong background in mathematics. Notice that this course is not a close substitute for the first course in the Tepper microeconomics sequence. Students who want to take more advanced microeconomics courses and who have the preparation are encouraged to investigate the courses offered at Tepper.  There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, students are assumed to have a solid working knowledge of multivariate calculus. You will take a brief math quiz in the first lecture to help you determine whether your math training is sufficient for the course. Prior exposure to microeconomics, in a good undergraduate-level course, is helpful but not required.",

The course teaches students the building blocks of strategic planning and introduces students to the contested theories of how to develop and implement plans.  The content of the course includes exploring the basic concepts used in strategic planning; distinguishing between operational matters (organisational effectiveness) and strategic matters (leadership); analysing the organisations internal and external environments; and achieving alignment between them. A considerable amount of time is spent on developing skills to frame issues correctly so that strategic plans address the organisations true needs. Finally, the course addresses implementation issues, particularly those requiring change management. Students are encouraged to draw upon skills acquired in other areas, such as finance, marketing, organization management etc. in formulating the strategic plan. The assignments includes students forming teams of 4-6, with each team working on a strategic planning project with a Government agency or not-for-profit organization based in South Australia. The actual projects are sourced by the course instructor with students being able to lodge expressions of interest for their preferred project. At the end of the course, students should be able to:              Analyse the mandates, missions and values of any organisation, with particular focus on public organisations              Frame issues in a manner that allows them to be assessed as strategic              Develop strategies              Prepare implementation and change management plans.",

The course goes beyond a principles of arts management position to introduce students to the local, national, and international forces that make running an arts-based business unique.  Students discover how arts enterprises are governed internally (formal leadership) and externally (public policy, market forces, and financial realities). Furthermore, students learn how enterprises engage multiple stakeholders, from artists or politicians to staff or audiences. Almost daily, arts managers are faced with choices that affect internal operation dynamics and external stakeholder relations.  During the course, students will discern the day-to-day systems and operations of well-run arts organizations and investigate moments of failure in order to find the lessons learned. The course provides a lens into the nexus of institution-artist-audience within a framework of mission-impact and ROI.  This course provides students with both the fundamentals and the emerging practices within arts enterprises creating a foundation for subsequent, advanced coursework. Students will encounter the theoretical frameworks necessary to understand the enterprise, and then ground the theory in real-life experience, case studies, and course-exercises.  The course is organized in 4 modules: Public Policy and the Arts, Law and Structuring a Business, Running the Enterprise, and Issues in the Field.  For the purpose of this course, arts enterprises will be defined as those that create relationships between artists and audiences. Arts enterprises include, but are not limited to: orchestras, opera companies, music ensembles, museums, arts centers, theatre companies, presenting organizations, multi-media centers, artist agencies, galleries, media and dance companies.",

        "desc": "The performing arts industry has had a varied  lively history in the United States for the last 175 years (essentially once train travel allowed for broad distribution of artists across the nation). In the beginning the arts were for entertainment  profit. Today, the need to entertain  pay the bills persists, yet it is set within a (mostly) nonprofit landscape in which performing arts organizations produce works to transform audiences via one or several intersecting art forms.  Producing a successful season entails selection (planning)  implementation (managing) of programs, something that is neither easy nor consistent.  Driving  complicating the situation is the usual bifurcated management structure.  Managers must find a way to implement the vision an Artistic Director - an individual with an aesthetic framework that shapes an institution  its artistic offerings. Arts managers enable his or her artistic vision within the context of the physical, geographical  financial situation of a company.  Combining  mixing these forces is frequently messy  always an adventure.  Organizational history provides some structures to the process, but each season brings new artistic  managerial challenges against a backdrop of a rapidly changing society. If a career of doing the same thing is the goal then a different field might be recommended.     This course will examine approaches to producing a performing arts season of programming with an emphasis on the nonprofit season structure.  Over 7 short weeks we will attempt to answer the following question: How do managers move an organization mission through an artistic vision set across a selection of programs  create a system to manage the process  evaluate artistic success, community impact  mission-centric strategic goals? How can arts leaders commission new works in an environment that provides greater earned income for doing things people already know?",

This is especially relevant with the challenge of understanding and analyzing data on customers, product offerings, and channels. How can different sources and types of data be used to help inform product development, market channel analysis and customer service and support? Today, marketing is to some extent defined outside the traditional marketing department, so how can the next generation of marketers address this challenge? This course provides an overview of marketing concepts focusing on definitions, mechanics, and practices. We will cover the basics of marketing but also delve into marketings role within various departments across the enterprise including supply chain logistics, sales force automation and public relations. We will have in-class exercises weekly to help students think about marketings impact on various products and services as well as understand how digital, mobile, social and IoT are quickly changing the marketing landscape.

Negotiation is not only a talent you can be born with, its also a skill that can be learned This course focuses on improving fundamental negotiating competencies in personal and organizational contexts. Negotiation is both an art and a science. This course will teach you how to negotiate more effectively through a combination of assessments, exercises and simulations. In subject matter and approach this class is designed to provide understanding and insight into your present negotiating abilities, as well as challenge your comfort zone to allow for continuous improvement going forward. Negotiation is fast-paced, interactive and hands-on. Drawing upon current research and recognized best practices, we will emphasize both basic mastery and practical application of the subject matter covered. In that respect, and perhaps unlike your other classes at the Heinz College, this course will have elements of both education (learning about) and training (learning how to).",

Acting for Management will help you utilize the actors tools to become a more powerful and persuasive presenter, to feel more confident when communicating with others, to understand your audience and to show the world the best and most authentic version of you.   Through in-class exercises, prepared acting scenes and discussion, we will explore the use of physical tools (voice and body) as well as non-physical tools (imagination, emotion, focus, intention).  Exercises and scenes will include situations you will encounter in professional organizations such as teamwork, conflict and power, among others. Because success in professional settings depends on your ability to clearly and dynamically communicate your ideas and skillfully navigate the politics of the organization, our focus for the class will be how to transfer the actors tools to real-world situations.  Acting for Management is about you and your individual growth.  To make the most of it, you will need to attend all classes and participate fully in activities.    Learning Outcomes At the conclusion of this class, you should: -Be able to define your strengths as a presenter and areas for continued work -Use the actors tools to shape your performances and presentations -Exhibit increased confidence in performing and presenting -See an increase in your willingness to be spontaneous and take risks",

        "desc": "Privacy is a complex and multi-faceted concept. This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.  The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive. Is there a sweet spot that satisfies the interests of all parties? Is there a combination of technological solutions, economic incentives, and legal safeguards that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society?  This course tries to address the above questions. In particular, the course begins by comparing early definitions of privacy to the current information-focused debate. It then focuses on:  - technological aspects of privacy (privacy concerns raised by new IT such as the Internet, wireless communications, and computer matching; tracking techniques and data mining; privacy enhancing technologies and anonymous protocols,), - economic aspects (economic models of the market for privacy, financial risks caused by privacy violations, the value of customer information, - legal aspects (laissez-faire versus regulated approaches, US versus EU legal safeguards,)   - managerial implications (the emerging role of Chief Privacy Officers, compulsory directives and self-regulative efforts, and - policy aspects (trade-offs between individual privacy rights and societal needs,)",

Each semester (Spring and Fall), we bring in 7 companies to provide challenging projects for the student teams. Teams are provided with commercially available tools to listen to online social conversations, measure activity, assess different market segments, understand social influence and identify how information get disseminated across social channels. Previous sponsors have included: Under Armour, Netflix, Target, The Washington Post, HBO, Daimler, eBay, Google, ATT, The Pittsburgh Steelers, etc. The class is designed to teach social analytics, consulting methodologies, critical thinking to weed through ambiguity, project management as well as team and relationship development. Lectures focus on how social is impacting different industries, culture and communication, as well as the future of work. Teams work with their clients throughout the semester and present their findings/deliverables during final presentations when all 7 sponsors come to CMU. In the past, teams have built social applications, social algorithms, experimental methodologies, crowdsourced campaigns and real time information dash boards for their clients. This class offers an opportunity for students interested in analyzing social data, working in a consultative fashion with actual clients on real issues, and learning about global issues associated with an increasingly social culture.",

Customer satisfaction surveys, alumni surveys, consumer product surveys, political surveys, health surveys,  public opinion polls represent just a few of the types of surveys most of us routinely encounter. Moreover, national news organizations  the popular press deliver the results from their latest surveys on a daily basis. To what extent can you trust the results? Are the survey results flawed by inappropriate survey design  methods? This course introduces you to a set of principles  methods in survey design that are the based on the scholarship that informs best practices in the field. We will use the concept of total survey error to frame an understanding of the key issues in survey research, including sampling frames, survey statistics, modes of data collection, non-response, question structure, wording, context  other important features of survey administration  data collection. By developing your own survey, you will examine the major decisions faced by a professional who wants to design  administer high-quality surveys.  The course will focus heavily on class discussion of readings, in-class group work  a survey design project. For this reason, attendance  active participation are important for successful learning in this course. I want to turn you into a Survey Snob. I know this sounds odd, but I want you to become a sophisticated  critical consumer  producer of surveys. To accomplish this, you will need to develop an understanding of the fundamental principles of survey research  design. After this course, I hope that you look at surveys through a new set of eyes. You will be able to distinguish poorly-constructed surveys from well-constructed surveys. You will be able to design  administer surveys that support the social, research,  data collection needs of the organizations  institutions to which you belong.",

Design thinking has been applied to the development of new products, the solution of social problems, the design of new business models and the improvement of existing processes. Design thinking is based in five premises which pervade the creative process: - User centered: Empathy for the people you are designing for and feedback from these users is fundamental to a good solution. - Experimentation: Communicate your vision by creating experiences, using illustrations, prototypes and stories meaningful to your users - Reframing the problem: Formulating the problem in different ways, one level above the current reality, one level down or from different points of view. - Collaboration: Problems and solutions are identified with the participation of all key stakeholders by s a cross-functional team that looks at many aspects of the solution.  Objectives: By the end of the course the student should be able to: Decide the suitability of applying design thinking in a given context Explain the design thinking process and its most common tools  Apply the design thinking process in the context of a service or software product definition",

In this course well explore both ends of the spectrum as we deconstruct and reconstruct data visualizations, dig into our own stories informed by data in compelling ways to help our readers understand complex issues, and experiment with new ways to represent data about our work, our community, and even ourselves.  This course will provide hands-on training and experimentation with a number of tools, and students will have some flexibility to concentrate on mediums that best match their desired outcomes for a final project deliverable (print, digital, interactive or immersive). By the end of this course, students will have developed a portfolio of work, skills in a number of different tools and applied techniques, and a more thorough understanding of how to communicate through presentation and data design.

Thinking of designed technologies in relation to different models and ways of seeing and thinking about the word we live in is crucial for practitioners involved in any kind of change through technological interventions, whether at the level of technology production, or deployment, or policy. This mini course introduces students to designerly approaches using systems theory. It aims to sensitize them to a range of different ways to frame and think about systems and expose them to a range of specific systems thinking techniques and terminologies for analyzing complex natural, socio-cultural and technological phenomena and making evaluable changes to those phenomena. As a result, by the end of the course students will expect to have developed a better sense of where and how to effective interventions and gauge the effects and impacts of those interventions.",

This course examines the reasons for the inherent complexity of software construction, and presents structured methods to deal effectively with it. The course will focus on the object-oriented approach for analysis and design. Students will gain an appreciation of the difference between writing programs and doing analysis and design. Problem formulation and decomposition (analysis) and solution building (design) will be covered. Students will work in small groups, each group having the responsibility for analysis, design and implementation of a software system. Case tools will be used in several stages of the development process.  Knowledge of an Object-Oriented language such as Java or C++ is a pre-requisite for this course.",

Microeconomics, as discussed in this course, focuses on the models and methods by which managers can analyze their market and organizational environment to make optimal decisions.  The key to such optimal decision-making is an understanding of the trade-offs in allocating scarce resources. The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing, production, and finance.  The course will begin with an examination of the underlying structure and models of competitive markets, and the efficiency and welfare implications of those models.  We will then examine economic models that describe firm output, pricing and entry/exit decisions.  These models will then be applied to a variety of market contexts, including monopoly, oligopoly, and competition.  As we go through this analysis, we will seek to understand the implications of the theory for information technology firms.  We will also examine interesting dynamics between information, agents and economic outcomes in the context of game theory.  Most of our discussions of the economic models will be accompanied by explorations of the ideas and examples presented in the Shapiro and Varian text.",

As a consequence, there is a strong need for individuals that understand the nature of these innovations and the complex ways in which they may affect marketplaces. In line with this need, this course is about understanding technology-driven disruption from a managerial point of view. The course combines several lectures introducing fundamental concepts of economics and management applied to technology-enabled markets, such as multi-sided platforms, direct and indirect network effects, diffusion and critical mass, market power, economies of scale, winner-takes-all markets, pricing strategies, multi-homing, switching costs, differentiated services, versioning, bundling, envelopment attacks and cross-boundary disruptors. These lectures are complemented by case studies looking at specific real-world companies focusing on innovative technologies like social networks, online marketplaces and the sharing economy. Students learn how to anticipate disruptive technologies and are exposed to frameworks and tools to characterize and manage these technologies in the workplace.",

This course will explore the origins of NoSQL databases and the characteristics that distinguish them from traditional relational database management systems. Core concepts of NoSQL databases will be presented, followed by an exploration of how different database technologies implement these core concepts. We will take a closer look at 1-2 databases from each of the four main NoSQL data models (key-value, column family, document, and graph), highlighting the business needs that drive the development and use of each database. Finally, we will present criteria that decision makers should consider when choosing between relational and non-relational databases and techniques for selecting the NoSQL database that best addresses specific use cases.",

        "desc": "The ability to secure information within a modern enterprise is a growing challenge. Threats to information security are global, persistent, and increasingly sophisticated. Long gone are the days when managers could hope to secure the enterprise through ad hoc means.   Effective information security at the enterprise level requires participation, planning, and practice.  Fortunately, the information security community has developed a variety of resources, methods, and best practices to help modern enterprises address the challenge. However, employing these tools demands a high degree of commitment, understanding, and skillattributes that must be sustained through constant awareness and training.  An essential part of the information security plan is cyber security policy  this includes the written plans for how the enterprise IT assets will be protected.   This course provides students with information on the origin of cyber security policy, governance structures for policy creation, selection and implementation of policy, and audit and control functions to ensure compliance and efficacy. Students will be exposed to the national and international policy and legal considerations related to cybersecurity and cyberspace such as privacy, intellectual property, cybercrime, homeland security (i.e., critical infrastructure protection) and cyberwarfare, and the organizations involved in the formulation of such policies. Broader technology issues also are discussed to demonstrate the interdisciplinary influences and concerns that must be addressed in developing or implementing effective national cybersecurity laws and policies.",

The first half of the course focuses on deterministic optimization, and covers linear programming, network optimization and integer programming. The second half of this course introduces risk and uncertainty, and includes methods to characterize uncertainty and methods to optimize decisions under uncertainty. Examples are drawn from a variety of domains where these decision-making methods can provide value for business and policy, such as transportation, energy, health care, manufacturing, supply chain management, etc. The readings, lectures, homework assignments and exams will help you develop modeling skills, computational skills and analytical skills. Modeling skills involve translating a problem into a well-defined mathematical framework, using little more than pen and paper. Computational skills involve solving your model on a computer program. In this course, all applications will be done in Excel. Analytical skills involve critically interpreting a model and translating results into insights for decision-making. All three are important COURSE OBJECTIVES 1. Become familiar with advanced Excel functions. This helps you get a job. 2. Survey optimization and decision science methods. This helps you hire consultants intelligently, should you need to. 3. Learn some analytical methods. This helps you solve smaller problems yourself and develop intuition for more complex problems. 4. Learn how to develop a mathematical model. This helps you think clearly and precisely, and will give you an edge on the marketplace.",

These questions and others are addressed using an eclectic mix of in-class exercises, guest lecturer presentations, and personal story-sharing. We will examine the concepts of initiative, integrity, power, control, and authority.  In todays business world, the ability to work within - and lead - groups of all sizes becomes a prime requisite for success at the managerial and executive level. Business and technical acumen is the entry fee to professional success; the ability to lead is distinguishing.  This is an open discussion course wherein students are required to share their own stories as they listen to those of their peers.  Numerous studies have identified only one trait shared by all successful leaders: failure. By sharing our failures, and being exposed to the challenges our peers and guest lecturers have faced, we learn about leadership, small group social dynamics, and ourselves.",

Too few entrepreneurs appreciate this fact and, as a result, many start without the essential skills talents and capabilities needed to set the company on a successful path. Some of these entrepreneurial skills can only be learned through starting and growing a business while others can be learned. This course attempts to bridge the challenging gap between learning and doing entrepreneurship.  We introduce you to an essential skill of market discovery or learning to create, develop and evaluate your concept of your business. Is my idea a real innovation? Is it also a business or a product or neither? How do I know how big the market is for my product? What are the technology market and competitive risks in my idea and how do I assess them? Can I compete? Can I sell it? How? When? Where?  Students will have the opportunity to apply their newfound practical skills gathered in part from lectures from experienced entrepreneurs and investors to case studies role-playing and solving actual problems of local tech businesses.       The best way to learn entrepreneurship is by doing, which is why this course will use true-to-life scenarios as the anchor for the course. The class will be divided into 4 teams will focus on a company that is either (1) a student idea for new start-up, (2) an existing start-up (ideally local) or (3) a hypothetical start-up proposed/conceived by the students, the professor or both.",

The course is divided into three distinct modules: descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and regression analysis. The emphasis of the classes on descriptive statistics is the calculation and interpretation of summary statistical measures for describing raw data. The sessions on statistical inference are designed to provide you with the background for executing and interpreting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The final component of the course focuses on regression analysis, a widely used statistical methodology. Throughout the course you will regularly analyze data relevant to management and policy analysis using the Excel statistical software package.",

The class will begin with an in-depth review of baseline data warehouse principles and concepts.  Once the basic principles have been established, the remainder of the class will be built around a group data warehouse project.  The project will begin with your group gathering requirements and developing a data warehouse design.  Once the design is complete you will build a prototype data warehouse containing the necessary structures within your database and populating them with source data.  This will require you to develop the table definitions, extract/transformation/load (ETL) logic, and example report definitions.  I intend this class to be a hands-on example of a simple data warehouse implementation.",

We aim at answering questions such as: how does the demand for a product change when the price does or the ratings do? how can we anticipate how sales  profits change if the firm changes its business strategy? how can we measure whether introducing technology in schools, universities /or classrooms affects the performance of students? Many companies  Governmental agencies ask  try to answer questions of this type every day. Moreover, they are now also actively seeking tools that can take advantage of big datasets to answer these questions as well as skillful individuals that know how to use them confidently. This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects  we discuss their pros  cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild. The concepts  tools discussed in this course are general in nature  can be applied in different settings. The examples discussed in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry  education policy. Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts related to A/B testing  what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas  intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study several real-world datasets  the code used to analyze them properly.

Machine learning is transforming fields with new capabilities, ways of understanding and visualizing data, and is becoming a key driver in decision making. However, knowing when (and how) to apply appropriate machine learning techniques requires understanding of data, machine learning, and the problem domain. This class seeks to teach students how to address the entire machine learning pipeline, starting from messy data and provisional questions and ending with actionable interpretations and insights.  The course will cover discovery, planning, analysis, and interpretation. Discovery involves understanding the data at hand, determining what is and is not answerable, and question generation. Planning involves contrasting the application of the desired machine learning method on ideal clean data with the messy data at hand. Dealing with representation, missing data, and designing appropriate machine learning machinery are all involved in planning. Analysis involves applying the machine learning method, checking model performance and assumptions in a principled and responsible manner. Interpretation involves the transformation of algorthm outputs into meaningful and actionable characterizations of the results. Each part of the pipeline is interconnected and students will learn to anticipate and address limitations through understanding of the pipeline as a whole.  Throughout the course we will focus on one vertical, health care, recognizing that the methods developed will generalize to others. We will work with real, messy, structured and unstructured data--including databases, text, and images. We will contrast machine learning methods against what is currently used in health care analytics, and describe the advantages and promise of each.",

        "desc": "Companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video. How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as unstructured. This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach. We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. Along the way, we encounter many of the most popular methods in analyzing unstructured data, from modern classics in manifold learning, clustering, and topic modeling to some of the latest developments in deep neural networks for analyzing text, images, and time series. We will be coding lots of Python and working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud computing (including using GPUs). Note that students cannot receive credit for both 95-865 (Unstructured Data Analytics) and 94-775 (Unstructured Data Analytics for Policy).

Firms know micro level data about customer transactions and have an ability to correlate such data with other datasets. In this course, we will learn powerful but simple probability/statistical models that can be applied to fit these data to generate useful predictions. The course will go beyond pattern detections, clustering, or correlation in data to build models of plausible consumer behavior that generates the data. Thus the goal is to build a model of consumer behavior and apply this model to data to test how accurate this model is and tweak it if necessary. Most importantly, with such a model in hand, we want to predict how outcomes will change if the firm changed its strategy.

Like archaeological remnants, data, by its very nature, is a marker of what happened in the past. How can data be used to better understand this past and what is happening in the present? How can data be leveraged to forecast what will happen in the future? Better still, how can data be used to mold what should happen in the future? In this course we will study descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods by which data can be used to gain insight and inform actions of people and organizations. The real excitement of data science is in the doing. This is an application oriented course requiring skill in algorithmic problem solving. We will use Python based data science tools.
